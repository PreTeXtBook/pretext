MathBook XML (MBX) is guided by the following principles:
---------------------------------------------------------

1) MBX is a markup language that captures the structure of
textbooks and research papers in the mathematical sciences.

2) MBX is human-readable and human-writable.

3) MBX documents serve as a single source which can be
easily converted to multiple other formats, current and future.

4) MBX respects the good design practices which have been
developed over the past centuries.

5) MBX makes it easy for authors to implement features which
are both common and reasonable.

6) MBX supports online documents which make use of the full
capabilities of the Web.

7) MBX output is styled by selecting from a list of available
templates, relieving the author of the burden involved
in micromanaging the output format.

8) MBX is free: the software is available at no cost, with an
open license. The use of MBX does not impose any constraints
on documents prepared with the system.

9) MBX is not a closed system: documents can be converted to
LaTeX and then developed using standard LaTeX tools.
