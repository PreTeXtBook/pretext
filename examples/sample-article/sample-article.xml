            <p>You can give a Sage element a <c>doctest</c><idx>doctest</idx><idx><h>attributes</h><h>doctest</h></idx> attribute, whose value mirrors the optional hash tags used in Sage doctests.  Possible values are <c>random</c>, <c>long time</c>, <c>not implemented</c>, <c>not tested</c>, <c>known bug</c>, <c>absolute</c>, <c>relative</c>, and <c>optional</c>.  The values <c>absolute</c> and <c>relative</c> refer to floating-point tolerances for equality and require a second attribute <c>tolerance</c> to specify a floating point value.  The value <c>optional</c> refers to the test requiring that an optional Sage package be present.  The name of that package should be provided in the <c>package</c> attribute.</p>

            <p>The next cell is marked in the source as <c>doctest="random"</c>, and so is specified as unpredictable and not tested.  But there is some <q>sample</q> output which will appear in the <latex /> version (and always be the same).</p>

            <p>While the next cell is random, the returned value will never be more than <m>0.01</m> away from <m>12</m>, since the <c>random()</c> function stays between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>.  So we provide <m>12.005</m> as the expected answer, but test with an absolute tolerance of <m>\epsilon=0.006</m>.</p>

            <p>Sage, and by extension, the Sage Cell Server, can interpret several languages.  The next example has code in the <c>R</c> language,<idx><h>R</h></idx> a popular open source language for statistics.  As an author, you add the attribute <c>language="r"</c> to your <c>sage</c> element.  (The default language is Sage, so you do not need to indicate that repeatedly.)  Note that a language like <c>R</c> likes to use a <q>less than</q> character, &lt;, special character in XML.  You need to escape it by writing <c>&amp;lt;</c> as we have done in the source for this example.  (See the discussion in <xref ref="subsection-xml-escape" text="type-global"/>.)</p>

            <p>As a reader you learn that the <q>Evaluate</q> button for a pre-loaded Sage cell will indicate the language in use.</p>

            <sage doctest="not tested" language="r">
                <input>
                ruth &lt;- c(22, 25, 34, 35, 41, 41, 46, 46, 46, 47, 49, 54, 54, 59, 60)
                bonds &lt;- c(16, 25, 24, 19, 33, 25, 34, 46, 37, 33, 42, 40, 37, 34, 49, 73, 46, 45, 45, 5, 26, 28)
                dimaggio &lt;- c(12, 14, 20, 21, 25, 29, 30, 30, 31, 32, 32, 39, 46)
                summary(ruth)
                summary(bonds)
                summary(dimaggio)
                boxplot(ruth, bonds, dimaggio)
                </input>
            </sage>

            <p>The Sage Cell Server supports the following languages:  <c>sage</c>, <c>gap</c>, <c>gp</c>, <c>html</c>, <c>maxima</c>, <c>octave</c>, <c>python</c>, <c>r</c>, and <c>singular</c>.</p>

            <p>Here is another <c>R</c> cell.  Unfortunately, it seems Sage's <c>doctest</c> facility cannot be used easily with code from other languages.  In the source for this example, we have employed the <init>XML</init> escape sequence, <c>&amp;lt;</c> several times (see <xref ref="subsection-xml-escape" text="type-global"/>).</p>

            <sage language="r">
                <input>
                age &lt;- c(25, 30, 56)
                gender &lt;- c("male", "female", "male")
                weight &lt;- c(160, 110, 220)
                mydata &lt;- data.frame(age,gender,weight)
                summary(mydata)
                cor(mydata$age,mydata$weight)
                mean(mydata$age)
                sd(mydata$age)
                plot(mydata$age,mydata$weight)
                </input>
            </sage>

            <p>Here is a blank Sage cell that you may use for practice and experimentation with the commands above.  Note that this cell allows a choice of languages, and is not linked with any of the previous cells, so a reader would need to start fresh, or cut/paste definitioons from other cells.</p>

            <sage type="practice" />

            <p>On the other hand a <tag>sage</tag> element with no content will also create an empty Sage cell for the reader's use, but now it will be specific to a particular language and linked to others of the same language.  Run the <c>R</c> cell above that defines the variable <c>ruth</c> and then try typing <c>summary(ruth)</c> in the cell below.  (The linking seems a bit buggy, as it repeats the boxplot in the output, as of 2016-06-13).</p>

            <sage language="r" />

            <p>You can make Sage blocks which are of <c>type="invisible"</c>, which will never be shown to a reader, but which get doctested.  Why do this?  If some code produces an error, and you hope it is fixed someday, use an invisible block to raise the error.  Once fixed, the doctest will fail, and you can adjust your commentary to suit.  There is such a block right now, <em>but</em> you will need to go to the source to see it.</p>

            <p>Our maximum width for text, designed for readability, suggests you should format your Sage code with a maximum of about 54 characters. On a mobile device, the number of displayed characters might be as low as 28 in portrait orientation, and again around 50 in landscape.  You can use a variety of techniques to shorten long lines, such as using intermediate variables.  Since Sage is just a huge Python library, you can use any of Python's facilities for handling long lines.  These include a continuation character (which I try to avoid using) or natural places where you can break long lines, such as between entries of a list.  Also, if writing loops or functions, you may wish to have your indentation be only two characters wide (rather than, say, four).</p>

            <p>Sage output can sometimes be quite long, though this has improved with some changes in Sage's output routines.  Output code should be included primarily for doctesting purposes, and in this use, you may break at almost whitespace character and the doctesting framework will adjust accordingly.  You may wish to show sample output in a static format, like a PDF, so you can consider formatting your output to fit the width constraints of that medium.  Or you may even adjust exactly what is output, to keep it from being too verbose.  Sage doctesting also allows for a wild-card style syntax which allows you to skip over huge chunks of meaningless or unpredictable output, such as tracebacks on error messages.</p>

        <!--
        Next section illustrates more involved presentation of
        mathematics.  The "mdn" element is shorthand for
        "mathematics display, numbered".  There is a "men"
        element for "math equation, numbered" and a "md" for
        "math display" (with no numbers).  Numbering may be
        selectively suppressed or enabled, per line (shown
        here once).  An "xml:id" alias may be used on any
        numbered line.

        Multi-line displays ("md", "mdn") require that lines
        be delimited as "math rows" with the "mrow" element.
        These displays are implemented with the AMSMath align
        environment, which uses ampersands (&) for formatting
        control.  This is an evil situation, but the (easy) way
        around it is to use "&amp;" in this situation.

        The previous sections were sequences of paragraphs, along with
        theorems, Sage code, etc.  The next section has subsections, so
        the structure must look like *only* subsections, excepting a
        brief introduction and conclusion (that are sequences of
        paragraphs and other blocks.)

                    <p>The Fundamental Theorem explains why we use the same notation for a definite integral, which is a numerical calculation,<fn>Which I think sometimes students lose sight of.</fn> and an antiderivative, which is a symbolic expression.</p>

                    <p>Using an <q>integral sign</q> for an antiderivative (aka indefinite integral) would seem to make the Fundamental Theorem a <foreign xml:lang="fr-FR">fait accompli</foreign>.

                    <introduction>
                        <p>A set of reading questions may have an <tag>introduction</tag>, perhaps for preparatory explanation.</p>
                        <p>If a student has logged in to the HTML version,
                           then they can answer the reading questions directly in the book.
                           Inline math LaTeX can be entered using
                           <c>$</c>...<c>$</c> or <c>\(</c>...<c>\)</c> delimiters,
                           and inline AsciiMath using backticks <c>`</c>...<c>`</c> as delimiters.
                           Here are some `gratuitous backticks` to check that AsciiMath is only
                           active in the answers to reading questions.
                        </p>
                    </introduction>

                    <exercise xml:id="first-reading">
                      <p>
                        This is a <term>reading question</term> that you might have a student answer prior to a class session,
                        based on reading part of the book.
                        A quick glance before class can help you tailor class time to the specific needs of your students.
                        The perfect reading question will reveal whether the student has read and understood the material,
                        and will be difficult to answer if they have not.
                        What do you think of that?
                      </p>
                    </exercise>

                    <exercise>
                      <p>
                        And a second one, with a cross-reference to the first,
                        as a check on numbering:
                        <xref ref="first-reading" text="type-global"/>.
                        Reading questions are allowed to have answers,
                        but providing answers misses the point of a reading question,
                        and the answer knowl interacts poorly with the mechanism used to
                        allow students to answer directly in the book.
                        Do you think the schema should ban answers to reading questions?

                <title>Theorem-Like Environments</title>

                <p>There are a variety of pre-defined environments in <pretext />.  All take a title, and must have a statement.  Some have proofs (theorems, corollaries, <etc />), while some do not have proofs (conjectures, axioms, principles).</p>

                    <title>The Title Principle</title>

                    <statement>
                        <p>It is a fundamental principle that many elements can have a title.  Try it and see. If you get better formatting, then it is being recognized.  If it looks very plain, check the documentation and perhaps make a feature request.</p>
                    </statement>

The elements <tag>axiom</tag>, <tag>conjecture</tag>, <tag>principle</tag>, <tag>heuristic</tag>, <tag>hypothesis</tag>, and <tag>assumption</tag> are functionally the same, barring a proof (since they would never have one!).

                <title>Linking Sage Cells</title>
                <idx><h>Sage cells</h><h>linking</h></idx>

                <p>Sage cells share their results on a per-webpage basis, so if you move to a new chapter, section, or subsection that happens to be on another webpage, your Sage computations are gone and you start fresh.  But maybe you need some results from elsewhere.  As an author, you can make an exact copy of a cell in another location by placing the code in an external file, which is pure text, freed from any need to format for XML processing.  So, in particular, there is no need to escape ampersands and angle brackets, nor is there employment of the <c>CDATA</c> mechanism.  But the real value is that there is just one version to edit, and any changes will be reflected in both copies.  We demonstrate this in the sample book, since it has the <c>xinclude</c> mechanism in place.  In the chapter on groups, find the section on Sage and then find the discussion of subgroups, and you will find an example of two identical Sage cells produced from one source file.</p>

                    <p>This section of this article has subsections and subsubsections.  In a book you can have chapters enclosing multiple sections.  There is one finer subdivision, it is achieved with the <c>paragraphs</c> element.</p>

                    <p>It is basically a sequence of paragraphs, where the first one gets an inline title.  You are reading the second, and final, paragraph of one right now. It is useful for organizing very short documents, where numbered subdivisions might be overkill.</p>

                    <title>Assemblages: Collections and Summaries</title>

                    <p>An <tag>assemblage</tag> is a collection, or summary, that does not have much structure to it.  So you are limited to paragraphs and friends (<c>p</c>, <c>blockquote</c>, <c>pre</c>) and side-by-sides that do not contain captioned items (<c>sidebyside</c>, <c>sbsgroup</c>).  The intent is that contents are not numbered, so cannot be cross-referenced individually, and so also do not become knowls.  You may place <tag>image</tag>, <tag>tabular</tag>, and <tag>program</tag> inside a <tag>sidebyside</tag>, in addition to other objects that do not have captions.  Note that <c>p</c> may by extension contain lists (<c>ol</c>, <c>ul</c>, <c>dl</c>).  Despite limited structure, the presentation should draw attention to it, because the contents should be seen as more important in some way.  It should be <q>highlighted</q> in some manner.  If you need to connect the entire assemblage with material elsewhere, you can do that with the usual <c>xref/xml:id</c> mechanism.<idx><h>assemblage</h></idx></p>

                    <p>What have we seen so far in this (disorganized) sample?<ul>
                        <li><p>Theorems, definitions and corollaries. (<xref ref="section-fundamental-theorem" text="type-global" />)</p></li>

                <introduction>
                    <title>An Introductory Introduction</title>

                    <p>Any subdivision may have a sequence of paragraphs within an <tag>introduction</tag> that precedes subsequent further subdivisions.  You are reading one now.  They are always leaves of the document structure, so are rendered on some pages that reference the following subdivisions.</p>

                    <p>An introduction or conclusion is an extremely restrictive container with simple presentation.  A title is optional (and probably not advisable).  Content is meant to be short and unstructured, in particular, nothing that can be numbered is allowed.  If this feels <em>too</em> restrictive, then place your content in an initial numbered subdivision and perhaps title it <q>Introduction</q>.  Or make your entire subdivion unstructured and place whatever you want into it.</p>

                    <p>This ends this introduction to introductions.</p>
                </introduction>

                <subsubsection>
                    <title>Test One</title>

                    <p>An intervening subsubsection just after an introduction.</p>
                </subsubsection>

                <subsubsection>
                    <title>Test Two</title>

                    <p>An intervening subsubsection just before a conclusion.</p>
                </subsubsection>

                <conclusion>
                    <p>Entirely analogous to introductions are conclusions.  Any subdivision may have a sequence of paragraphs within a <tag>conclusion</tag> that follows previous further subdivisions.  You are reading one now.  They are always leaves of the document structure, so are rendered on some pages that reference the preceding subdivisions.</p>

                   <p>This concludes this conclusion (and this subsection and this section).</p>
                </conclusion>

            <subsection xml:id="subsection-paragraph-markup">
                <title>Some Paragraph-Level Markup</title>

                <p>Text within a paragraph may be <em>emphasized</em><idx><h>em</h><h>emphasis</h></idx><idx><h>styling words</h><h>em</h></idx><idx><h>styling words</h><h>emphasis</h></idx> with <tag>em</tag> or if you want to take it to the next level you can identify the text as an <alert>alert</alert><idx>alert</idx><idx><h>styling words</h><h>alert</h></idx> with <tag>alert</tag>.</p>

                <p>Similarly, within a paragraph, you can identify edits between versions as <insert>inserted text that has been added</insert><idx><h>styling words</h><h>insert</h></idx> with <tag>insert</tag> or as <delete>deleted text that has been removed</delete><idx><h>styling words</h><h>delete</h></idx> with <tag>delete</tag>.  Note that these identified edits are slightly different than <stale>stale text that you want to retain, but which is no longer relevant</stale><idx><h>styling words</h><h>stale</h></idx>, which is accomplished with <tag>stale</tag>.  The original request for stale text came from an instructor with an online list of student topics for presentations, and as students claimed topics they were marked as no longer available for other students.</p>

                <p>If you need a <q>fill-in blank</q>, like this<fillin />, it can be obtained with an empty <tag>fillin</tag> element that defaults to roughly a 10-character width.  You can use the <tag>characters</tag> attribute to make the rule longer or shorter, such as a 40-character blank: <fillin characters="40" />.  The character count is approximate, based on typical character widths within a proportional font carrying English language text.  Adjust to suit, or request a language-specific adjustment if it is critical.</p>

                <p>Long after we started this mess, we added <pretext /> tags to mark up tags and attributes.  The elements are: <tag>tag</tag>, <tag>tage</tag>, <tag>attr</tag>.  Examples of how these render are (respectively): <tag>section</tag>, <tage>hash</tage>, <attr>width</attr>.  Perhaps this document will make greater use of these tags.</p>

                <p>We supply two incomplete cross-references for testing purposes only: <xref provisional="a first incomplete cross-reference"/>, <xref provisional="a second incomplete cross-reference"/>.</p>
            </subsection>

            <conclusion>
                <p>A conclusion here, which we fill with some numbering tests.</p>

                <p>This is a cross-reference to one of the outcomes, forced to use the <c>type-global</c> form of the text.  It should describe the outcome as belonging to the <em>section</em> (rather than the <em>outcomes</em>), since outcomes are one-per-subdivision and are numbered based upon the containing division: <xref ref="outcome-structure" text="phrase-global" />.  For comparison this is the (forced) <c>type-global</c> cross-reference: <xref ref="outcome-structure" text="type-global" />.</p>

            <p><idx xml:id="index-finish-multicolumn" start="index-start-multicolumn" />The multi-row displayed mathematics in the proof of the Fundamental Theorem had equations aligned on the equals signs via the &amp; character.  Sometimes you don't want that.  Here is an example with some differential equations, with each equation centered and unnumbered,<md>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y')(s) = s {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - y(0) = s Y(s) - y(0)</mrow>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y'')(s) = s^2 {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)= s^2 Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)</mrow>
            </md>.<notation><usage>\rho</usage><description>this symbol could be used for lots of things, but we are just trying to make a super-long description to get it to wrap within the column where it belongs, which is sometimes set to a fixed width to accomodate really complicated explanations</description></notation>We test referencing notation here, placed <em>before</em> the sentence-ending period and right after some inline mathematics<mdash/>for <m>\mathbb{Z}_n</m><notation><usage>\mathbb{Z}_n</usage><description>(ring of) integers modulo <m>n</m></description></notation>.</p>

            <p><latex /> has a device where you can interrupt a sequence of equations with a small amout of text and preserve the equation alignment on either side.  Here are two tests of that device, with aligned equations and non-aligned equations.  Study the source to see use and differences.  (The math does not make sense.)</p>

            <p>Aligned and numbered first.<mdn>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y')(s)  &amp;= s {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - y(0) = s Y(s) - y(0)</mrow>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y'')(s) &amp;= s^2 {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)= s^2 Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0).</mrow>
                <intertext>And so it follows that,</intertext>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y')(s)^{++}  &amp;= s {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - y(0) = s Y(s) - y(0)</mrow>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y'')(s)^{5} &amp;= s^2 {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)= s^2 Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0).</mrow>
            </mdn></p>

            <p>Now with no numbers and no alignment.  We include two cross-references in the <c>intertext</c> portion for testing.<md>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y')(s)  = s {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - y(0) = s Y(s) - y(0)</mrow>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y'')(s) = s^2 {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)= s^2 Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0).</mrow>
                <intertext>First an external reference to <url href="http://example.com" /> and internal cross-reference to <xref ref="corollary-FTC-derivative" text="type-global" />. And so it follows that,</intertext>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y')(s)^{++} = s {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - y(0) = s Y(s) - y(0)</mrow>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y'')(s)^{5} = s^2 {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)= s^2 Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)</mrow>

            <p>Tables can get quite complex.  Simple ones are simpler, such as this example of numerical computations for Euler's method.</p>

            <title>Mathematics</title>

            <introduction>
                <p>To be able to create both <latex /> and HTML output (plus variations), we rely on MathJax, which in turn supports an extensive subset of the mathematical symbols normally available.  The AMSMath symbol set is a good approximation.  For a complete list, see the <url href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/tex.html#supported-latex-commands">MathJax Supported LaTeX commands</url>.  We load the <c>AMSsymbols</c> library and the library for extensible arrows, <c>extpfeil</c>.</p>
            </introduction>


            <subsection>
                <title>Basic Mathematics</title>

                <p>The following is from the MathJax <url href="http://www.mathjax.org/demos/tex-samples/">demonstration page</url>, an identity due to Ramanujan:<me>\frac{1}{\Bigl(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi\Bigr) e^{\frac25 \pi}} = 1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\ldots} } } }</me></p>

                <p>And again, from the MathJax demonstration page, Maxwell's equations:<idx>Maxwell's equations</idx><md>

                <p>A small test that the extensible arrows library is included properly:<me>A\xmapsto[\text{bijection}]{\Phi+\Psi+\Theta}B</me></p>

                <p>Look back at the top of the source file of this document to see how to include your <tex /> macros just once.  For best results keep your macros simple and semantic.</p>

                <p>Chris Hughes has made available <q>slanted</q>, or <q>beveled</q>, or <q>nice</q> fractions.  To wit, we mean fractions such as: <m>\sfrac{3}{8}</m>.  Use the built-in <c>\sfrac{}{}</c> macro in your mathematics to achieve this presentation.</p>

                <p>We consider a system of equations.  We number the first and last equation (there are just two) and include an <c>xml:id</c> on each.  We reference the whole system later as the range of equations from the first to the last.<mdn>
                    <mrow xml:id="equation-system-begin">\frac{dx}{dt} \amp = x^2 - 4x - y + 4</mrow>
                    <mrow xml:id="equation-system-end">\frac{dy}{dt} \amp = x^3 - y.</mrow>
                </mdn></p>

            </subsection>

            <subsection>
                <title>Displayed Mathematics</title>

                <p>Multi-line displays of mathematics are achieved with the <c>md</c> tag (<q>math display</q>), and the variant that produces numbers on each line, <c>mdn</c> (<q>math display numbered</q>), used within a paragraph (<c>p</c>).  As a good example of how XML syntax is superior, you author <m>n</m> lines of equations by enclosing each line inside of a <c>mrow</c> tag, rather than using <m>n-1</m> separators (such as <c>\\</c>).</p>

                <p>If you use no ampersands to express alignment (read ahead), then each equation is centered independently on the width of the text.  This is implemented according to the AMSmath <latex /> package's <c>gather</c> environment.  Example:<md>
                    <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 - 4x - y + 4</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} = x^3 - y.</mrow>
                </md></p>

                <p>An ampersand is used, in two ways, to describe positioning several equations per line, organized in columns.  We have created the pre-defined <latex/> macro <c>\amp</c> as one way specify these, but the escape sequence <c>&amp;amp;</c> may be used also.  The second, fourth, sixth, <ellipsis /> ampersands separate columns, and the spacing between columns will be provided automatically.  The first, third, fifth, <ellipsis /> ampersands are alignment points for the equations in each column.  Typically this is placed just prior to a binary operator, such as an equal sign (<c>\amp = </c>), or for a column of explanations or commentary, just prior to the <c>\text{}</c> macro.  Note that this scenario suggests always having an odd number of ampersands in each <c>mrow</c>.  In the example below, alignment is on the equals sign in the first two columns, and provides left-justification to the explanations in the third column.  N.B.: the use below of the <c>\text{}</c> macro does not include mathematics within its argument.  Doing so may yield unpredictable results depending on your choice of delimiters for the mathematics (and using an <c>m</c> tag will be ineffective).<md>
                    <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} \amp = x^2 - 4x - y + 4 \amp \frac{dy}{dt} \amp = x^3 - y          \amp\amp x, y\text{ version}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dw}{dt} \amp = z^3 - w          \amp \frac{dz}{dt} \amp = z^2 - 4z - w + 4 \amp\amp z, w\text{ version}</mrow>
                </md></p>

                <p><pretext /> will automatically detect the presence or absence of ampersands, but by defining macros for entire aligned equations, you can effectively hide the ampersands.  So the <c>@alignment</c> attribute can override automatic detection.  We use a simple <latex /> macro to demonstrate setting <c>alignment='align'</c> to override the use of a <c>gather</c> environment and use a <c>align</c> environment instead.  Example:<md alignment="align">
                    <mrow>\myequation{\frac{dx}{dt}}{x^2 - 4x - y + 4}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\myequation{\frac{dy}{dt}}{x^3 - y}.</mrow>
                </md></p>

                <p>The AMSmath <latex /> package's <c>alignat</c> environment is a third variant of alignment.  It never happens automatically, you need to ask for it with <c>alignment="alignat"</c>.  It is very similar to <c>align</c> but adds no space between the equation columns.  So you can leave it that way, or you can add your own <q>extra</q> space to suit.  Here is a previous example with no inter-column space:<md alignment="alignat">
                    <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} \amp = x^2 - 4x - y + 4 \amp \frac{dy}{dt} \amp = x^3 - y          \amp\amp x, y\text{ version}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dw}{dt} \amp = z^3 - w          \amp \frac{dz}{dt} \amp = z^2 - 4z - w + 4 \amp\amp z, w\text{ version}</mrow>
                </md>.  This modified example has a middle row with three columns, while the other rows have just one column, as a test of our routines for determining the <c>mrow</c> with the greatest number of ampersands (and how many there are),<md alignment="alignat">
                    <mrow>\frac{dw}{dt} &amp;= z^3 - w</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp;= x^2 - 4x - y + 4 &amp; \frac{dy}{dt} &amp;= x^3 - y&amp;&amp; x, y\text{ third column}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dw}{dt} &amp; = z^3 - w</mrow>
                </md>.  Final example demonstrates that ampersands in other objects (matrices here) can wreak havoc with computing the number of columns.  So we provide yet another attribute to override automatic detection, <c>alignat-columns</c>.  This is the number of <em>columns</em> not the number of <em>ampersands</em>.  Generally, for <m>c</m> columns, there will be <m>2c-1</m> ampersands.<md alignment="alignat" alignat-columns="2">
                    <mrow>A &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 2 \\ 3 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}
                    &amp;
                    I &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}</mrow>
                </md>.  One caveat: if your number of ampersands is even (see advice above about using an odd number) behavior should still be correct, as in next example.</p>

                <p>If you want super-precise control over alignment of the terms of a system of equations (linear or not) you can use the <c>alignat</c> option to advantage by not including any extra space.  This example is modified slightly from a post by Alex Jordan:<md alignment="alignat">
                    <mrow>2x \amp {}+{} \amp  y \amp {}+{} \amp 3z \amp {}={} \amp 10</mrow>
                    <mrow>x  \amp       \amp    \amp {}+{} \amp  z \amp {}={} \amp 6</mrow>
                    <mrow>x  \amp {}+{} \amp 3y \amp {}+{} \amp 2z \amp {}={} \amp 13.</mrow>
                </md>Beautiful.</p>

                <p>A long equation, to check layout on various screen sizes.  This is Weil's <q>explicit formula</q> for the
                   Riemann <m>\zeta</m>-function:

        - \frac{d}{2\pi}\hat S_-(0)\log \pi

                    <p>In print versions, a long run of displayed equations often needs to be broken across pages.  If you are reading some other version of this, then there is nothing to see here.  But for <latex /> output it could be interesting.  First, with no extra effort, this page-long display should break naturally, no matter how the preceding material changes.<md number="yes">

                    <p>So.  Do not take any extra steps and let <latex /> figure out the breaks.  If you do not like a break, modify the <c>md</c> or <c>mdn</c> to go back to the AMSmath default behavior and not break at all.  Ever.  Or rather, go further and modify an individual <c>mrow</c> to suggest that it is a good place for a break.</p>
                </example>

                <p permid="Cde">This is a poorly-authored paragaph to test the conversion to <init>HTML</init>.  There are two displayed equations, separated by a period ending the first one's sentence, which should migrate into the display, and not leave behind an empty paragraph: <me permid="Fgh">z+y = z</me>.  <me>a + b = c</me>.  This final sentence should remain, inside another <init>HTML</init> paragraph, without the second equation's period.</p>

                <title><latex /> Packages and MathJax Extensions</title>

                <p>If you would like to use macros from a <latex /> package <em>and</em> there is a MathJax extension <em>of the same name</em> which implements the same macros, then you may use these with your mathematics as we demonstrate here.</p>

                <p>This example is from Jason Underdown.<idx><h>Underdown, Jason</h></idx>  The package is named <c>cancel</c> and is included in the TeXLive distribution, so is fairly standard.  The particular macro being demonstrated is <c>\cancelto{}{}</c>.  <me>\lim_{b \rightarrow \infty}\left[\cancelto{0}{-\frac{1}{s}e^{-sb}} + \frac{1}{s}\right]</me>.   Look at the source of this article to see the package name being supplied in a <c>latex-preamble/package</c> element within the <c>docinfo</c> section.  That is the only setup required to make the macro usable in <latex /> and <init>HTML</init> output.<idx><h>canceling a term</h></idx><idx sortby="cancelto macro"><c>cancelto</c> macro</idx></p>

                <p>The packages appear before the author-supplied macros, so you can use macros from the packages as building blocks for document-specific macros.  We cannot guarantee there will be no conflicts between additional packages and those in use normally, or added in the future.  So use at your own risk.</p>

                <title>Advanced Mathematics</title>

                <p>MathJax is extremely capable in rendering a subset of <latex /> in web browsers, and improving all the time.  You can get fairly fancy with some of its supported commands.  In particular, if you need to mix in a few words with your mathematics, the <c>\text{}</c> macro is supported.  For example, you might use an <q>if</q> or an <q>otherwise</q> in the definition of a piecewise function.</p>

                <p>Consider that the first line below is text sandwiched in-between two Greek letters, wrapped in a <c>\text{}</c> macro.  In HTML output we have taken care that the font for text material within display mathematics should match the font of the  surrounding paragraph, as also happens with <latex /> output.  The second line is nearly identical in the source, but is just naked text being rendered like a slew of variables.<md>
                    <mrow>\alpha\text{ is not equal to }\beta</mrow>
                    <mrow>\alpha is not equal to \beta</mrow>
                    <mrow>\alpha\neq\beta</mrow>
                </md>.  We are not suggesting here that using words in place of symbols, as in the first line, is a good practice.  (It is not.)</p>

                <p>The following example is a good stress-test of using the <c>\text{}</c> macro to achieve certain effects.  Note the Unicode left and right smart quotes.  This a contribution from Alex Jordan as part of his work on <pubtitle>APEX Calculus</pubtitle>.<md>
                    <mrow>y \rightarrow \frac{\sin(0) }{0} \rightarrow {{\text{“}}\atop{}}\frac{0}{0}{{\text{”}}\atop{}}\text{.}</mrow>
                </md>And another one from Alex.  Note the use of the <c>\mathord{}</c> and <c>\mathrel{}</c> macros to control spacing around the mathematical symbols.  Examine the source to see how the quotation marks have been authored with <init>XML</init> syntax for Unicode characters, since we do not allow most markup inside mathematics.<md>
                    <mrow>\zeta(1)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}\mathrel{\text{ &#x201c;}\mathord{=}{\text{&#x201d; }}}\prod_{p}\left(\frac{1}{1-1/p}\right)=\prod_{p}\left(\frac{1}{1-p^{-1}}\right)</mrow>
                </md></p>

                <p>Generally, you cannot use any <init>XML</init> elements inside of the mathematics elements.  An exception is the <c>xref</c> element which you might want to use to provide justifications for the steps of a derivation.  Here is a visual example that is mathematically meaningless,<md>

                <title>Local Tags on Equations</title>

                <p>If you are not writing a research monograph, maybe (a) you will not use many numbered equations, or do not like the looks of them, or feel they scare your readers, and (b) maybe your cross-references are always local-ish, like strictly within an <c>example</c> or a <c>proof</c>.  For this situation you can create, and employ, a <q>local</q> tag on a displayed equation.  Nothing enforces the idea of what constitutes local, and there is nothing to stop you from using the same symbols more than once.  With freedom comes responsibility.</p>

                <p>Use the <c>@tag</c> attribute on an <c>mrow</c>, only.  (Remember, you can have just one <c>mrow</c>.)  The behavior is identical within an <c>md</c> or <c>mdn</c>.  The value of the <c>@tag</c> attribute is a symbol name.  The prefix <c>d</c> means <q>double</q>, and the prefix <c>t</c> means <q>triple</q>.  So allowed values are<cd>
                    <cline>star, dstar, tstar</cline>

            <introduction>
                <p><init>XML</init>, and therefore <pretext/>, is a markup language.  But by and large, what you type into your source will be what you see in your output.  So there is not much to say.  Except that <xref ref="subsection-xml-escape" text="type-global"/> eventually will be essential.  However we do test various tricky situations here (which have technical explanations we avoid).  See the Author's Guide for a superior treatment of the topics addressed here.</p>
            </introduction>

            <subsection xml:id="subsection-xml-escape">
                <title>Special <init>XML</init> characters</title>

                <p>One of the goals of <pretext/> is to relieve an author of managing the numerous conflicts when mixing languages that use different characters for special purposes.  But, of course, <init>XML</init> has its own special characters.</p>

                <p>If you type a <q>less-than</q> symbol in your source, the <init>XML</init> processor thinks you are starting an opening, or closing, tag.  So how do you get a less-than sign into your source so that it survives into your output, like this: &lt;<nbsp/>?  You use an <term>escaped version</term>.  Type literally, the four characters <c>&amp;lt;</c> in your source.  Then the <init>XML</init> processor will know you want the character and will not mistake it for a tag.  But now we want to get an ampersand into our source like: &amp;.  How?  Another escaped version of a character, literally the five characters <c>&amp;amp;</c>.</p>

                <p>Otherwise, keys on your keyboard, even international versions, should be fine in your source and behave as expected.  <init>WYTIWYG</init> = What You Type Is What You Get.  So the principal concession to using <init>XML</init> markup is the following very simple rule.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Rather than pressing the &lt; and &amp; keys on your keyboard, instead always enter the escape sequences <c>&amp;lt;</c> and <c>&amp;amp;</c> as replacements.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Simple.  And it will work in <q>running text,</q> verbatim text (like when authoring the content of <tag>c</tag> or <tag>pre</tag> elements), and mixed into <latex/> syntax to desribe mathematical expressions.  <init>XML</init> has three other escape sequences <c>&amp;gt;</c>, <c>&amp;apos;</c>, and <c>&amp;quot;</c>, for the characters &gt;, &apos;, and &quot; (respectively).  But they seem largely unnecessary for authoring in PreTeXt, as we now demonstrate by typing them directly from our keyboard into our source: &gt;, &apos;, and &quot;.</p>

                    <p>How was <c>&amp;amp;</c> authored?  Work it out, and then check the source here for the answer.</p>

                <title>Quotations</title>

                <p>The <tag>q</tag><idx><h>quotations</h></idx> tag will provide beginning and ending double quotations, while the <tag>sq</tag> tag will behave similarly but provide single quotes.  Given the complexity of quotations, the different symbols used in different languages, and the over-simplified versions provided on keyboards, it is necessary to use markup.</p>

                <p><q>The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet.</q> (Aristotle)</p>

                <p><sq>It is always wise to look ahead, but difficult to look further than you can see.</sq> (Winston Churchill)</p>

                <p>A large quote can be accomodated with the <tag>blockquote</tag> tag, which can carry within itself an <tag>attribution</tag> element.</p>

                <blockquote xml:id="blockquote-seuss">

                <p>Sometimes a quote may extend across several paragraphs.  Or a balanced pair of quotations marks crosses an XML boundary, so we need left, right, single and double versions.  (For example, see Section<nbsp /><xref ref="poetry" /> on poetry.)  Here are all four in a haphazard order: <rq />, <lsq />, <lq />, <rsq />.  These should be a last resort, and <em>not</em> a replacement for the <c>q</c> and <c>sq</c> tags.  The left/right versions are used for the following quote from Abraham Lincoln, which we have edited into two paragraphs.</p>

                <p><lq />I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true. I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live by the light that I have.</p>

                <p>I must stand with anybody that stands right, and stand with him while he is right, and part with him when he goes wrong.<rq /></p>

                <p>And as a tests, we try some crazy combinations of quotes, which would normally give <latex /> some trouble where the quotation marks are adjacent.<ul>
                    <li><p><q>we use <sq>single quotes inside of double quotes</sq></q></p></li>

                <p>It is possible to make some other groupings like quotations, such as {some <em>emphasized text</em> grouped within braces}, or [a <pubtitle>Book Title</pubtitle> inside brackets], an <articletitle>Article Title</articletitle>, <angles>some <foreign>foreign words</foreign> inside angle brackets</angles>, or <dblbrackets>just a bit of text within double brackets</dblbrackets>.  Some of these are used extensively by scholars who study texts to note various restorations or deletions.  Note that the <tag>foreign</tag> element may have a <c>xml:lang</c> attribute.</p>

                <p>Note that the angle brackets, <langle/> and <rangle/>, are <em>not</em> the keyboard characters, &lt; and &gt;.  Your best bet is to use the provided <tag>angles</tag> element when constructing a balanced pair.  Similarly, <tag>dblbrackets</tag> is provided to make the double-bracket characters easily available, since they are likely not on your keyboard.</p>

                <title>Characters, Symbols, and Constructions</title>

                <p>Some keyboard characters are ambiguous.  Is the character <c>'</c> an apostrophe or a right single quote?  We presume the former, ', and provide markup as an alternative for the latter (described above).  Is <c>/</c> used to separate words, or to form a fraction?  We presume the former, /, and provide <tage>solidus</tage>, <solidus/>, for the latter.  We test some other characters straight from our US keyboard (with two being escape sequences).</p>

                <p>~ ` ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * ( ) _ - + = [ ] { } | \ ; : ' " , &lt; . > ? /</p>

                <p>And again  as verbatim text.</p>

                <p><c>~ ` ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * ( ) _ - + = [ ] { } | \ ; : ' " , &lt; . > ? /</c></p>

                <p>Note that for a long time <pretext/> had empty elements for many of these characters, as a consequence of naïveté.  So you might see <tage>dollar</tage>, <tage>ampersand</tage>, or others in old source.  They will be deprecated and will raise warnings.</p>

                <p>Now, when a character is nowhere to be found on your keyboard, we provide conveniences as markup.  Here we test many of these.  Read the Author's Guide for tags and more detail.</p>

                <p>There are a few  common abbreviations of Latin phrases that can be achieved in HTML one way, and in <latex /> with a slightly different mechanism.  These are due to <latex />'s treatment of a period (full stop), depending on its surroundings.  So not reserved characters, but just divergent treatment.  Using these will lead to the best quality in all your outputs.  See Will Robertson's informative and arcane <url href="http://latex-alive.tumblr.com/post/827168808/correct-punctuation-spaces">blog post</url> on the topic if you want the full story for the treatment of a full stop in <latex />.</p>

Notice in the source that you <em>do not</em> put any tags inside the <c>href</c> attribute, but you may need to provide XML escape sequences, see <xref ref="subsection-xml-escape"/>).  Here is a totally bogus <init>URL</init>, which contains every possible legal character, so if this fails to convert there is some problematic character.  In order to test the use of a percent sign (<c>%</c>) in a URL, we follow it by two hex digits, specifically, <c>58</c>, which is a way to represent the character <c>X</c> in a <init>URL</init>.  Three versions: one with the content as normal text, one with the characters as verbatim text, and then as a <init>URL</init> with the same string of characters as the address and the clickable, viewable part.</p>

                <title>Special Situations</title>

                <p>Sage defines a nice syntax for generators of algebraic structures, but we must remember to use an escape sequence for the &lt; symbol (see <xref ref="subsection-xml-escape" text="type-global"/>).</p>

                <sage>
                    <input>
                    P.&lt;t> = ZZ[]
                    P
                    </input>
                    <output>Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Integer Ring</output>
                </sage>

                <p>There is an alternate Sage syntax, which avoids the less-than and greater symbols.</p>

                <sage>
                    <input>
                    R = ZZ['u']
                    u = R.gen(0)
                    (u, R)
                    </input>
                    <output>(u, Univariate Polynomial Ring in u over Integer Ring)</output>
                </sage>

                <p>Ampersands, less-than, and greater symbols are likely to be necessary in source code, such as Sage code (think generators of field extensions) or TikZ code (think arrowheads), and in matrices (think separating entries).  If you have a big matrix, or a huge chunk of TikZ code, you can protect it all at once from the XML processor by wrapping it in <c>&lt;![CDATA[</c><nbsp/><nbsp/><nbsp/><c>]]&gt;</c>.  It should be possible to write without ever using the <q>CDATA</q> mechanism, but it might get tedious in places to use the supplied macros or <init>XML</init> escape sequences.  This construction is often mis-understood as a solution better remedied by reading <xref ref="subsection-xml-escape" text="type-global"/> again.</p>

                <p>We test the three pre-defined <latex /> macros for &amp;, &lt;, and &gt; with a pair of aligned equations:<md>
                    <mrow>a^2 + b^2\amp\lt c^2</mrow>
                    <mrow>c^2\amp\gt a^2 + b^2</mrow>

                <p>A Jupyter notebook allows a mix of <init>HTML</init> (our logistical preference for a conversion) and Markown (another set of special characters and their escaped versions).  Certain pairs of delimiters, when appearing in consecutive <init>HTML</init> <tag>code</tag> elements require extraordinary care.  But the one nut we cannot crack is pairs of dollar signs.

                <title><latex/> Characters, Ligatures, and More</title>

                <p>This section is just for testing, and the more you know about <latex/>, the more we would encourage you to <em>not</em> to read this.  Look to the Author's Guide for the <em>right</em> way to author your source.</p>

                <p>The ten reserved characters, directly in the source: # $ % ^ &amp; _ { } ~ \.  And again: X#X$X%X^X&amp;X_X{X}X~X\X, but smashed up tight to intermediate characters.</p>

                <p>In a verbatim presentation: <c># $ % ^ &amp; _ { } ~ \</c>.</p>

                <p>And <c>X#X$X%X^X&amp;X_X{X}X~X\X</c>.  (These verbatim versions are authored in different paragraphs to work around the Jupyter notebook bug described above.)</p>

                <p>We also disrupt certain constructions from <latex/>.  Attempting to sneak-in any traditional macro for the purposes of <latex/>-only output, such as, say a \newpage, will fail since the leading backslash will be caught and converted to <c>\textbackslash</c>.  (See?  It just happened twice.)  For technical reasons we want to particularly test \textbackslash, \textbraceleft, and \textbraceright.</p>

                <p>Four <q><tex/> ligatures</q>, <c>--</c>, <c>---</c>, <c>``</c>, and <c>''</c>, authored in running text, --, ---, ``, ''.  It may be hard to tell that the two consecutive apostrophes have not coalesced into a curly left smart quote, but see below, the spacing is subtely different.</p>

                <p>We want the double quote mark from your keyboard, <c>"</c>, to not morph into some other character: "<nbsp/>.</p>

                <p>More testing: runs of hyphens.  Such as: - (one), -- (two), --- (three), ---- (four), ----- (five), ------ (six), ------- (seven).  Use the empty elements <tage>ndash</tage> and <tage>mdash</tage> for the longer dashes/hyphens.</p>

                <p>Runs of apostrophes should not become smart right double quotes:  ' (one), '' (two), ''' (three), '''' (four), ''''' (five), '''''' (six), ''''''' (seven).    You might want to cut-and-paste these into a text file to convince yourself there are the right number of characters.  Here are two smart right double quotes, separated by a non-breaking space, for visual comparison: <rq/><nbsp/><rq/>.  Or 30 apostrophes on a line of their own (longer) followed by 15 smart right double quotes (shorter).</p>
                <p>''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''.</p>
                <p><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/>.</p>

                <p>Runs of backticks (accent grave) should not become smart left double quotes when the output is processed by <latex/>:  ` (one), `` (two), ``` (three), ```` (four), ````` (five), `````` (six), ``````` (seven).  Furthermore, in a context where Markdown syntax is recognized as well (<eg/> a Jupyter notebook), paired backticks should <em>not</em> produce `inline verbatim text`.</p>

                <p>The next paragraph has a long run of words separated/joined by the keyboard forward-slash character.  With this input, <latex/> will not line-break at the slash, nor will it hypenate anywhere.  <pretext/>  automatically provides an improved slash, which will line-break, as you should see below in <latex/> output.  There is a bad right margin, but that is due to the absurdity of this test.  This sort of problem should be no better or worse for the use of this character.  Further refinements (zero-width space) and packages can be used to get hyphenation.  <init>HTML</init> will line-break rationally with no extra help.  Remember the <tage>solidus</tage> character for super-simple text fractions like 7<solidus/>32 (which will <em>not</em> line-break), and math elements or SI unit markup for technical work.</p>

                <title><init>HTML</init> and accidental mathematics</title>

                <p>We render mathematics in web pages with the fantastic MathJax Javascript library.  Simplifying just a bit, it recognizes <latex/> syntax within a page, takes control of that text, and replaces it wth nice fonts and formatting.  Now, if you write about <latex/> you might well have some mathematics in your examples.  Best practice would be to use verbatim text for that, and we mark off such text as being off-limits to MathJax.</p>

                <p>But if you are writing running text, then you can (accidentally) author some text which MathJax recognizes and converts to something (unintended).  And if you are doing this intentionally, then you have ignored <pretext/> markup for mathematics, and are missing out on some features.</p>

                <p>A few tests that we can prevent any accidents.</p>

            <title>Graphics</title>

            <introduction>
                <p>Mathbook XML supports several languages for describing diagrams and pictures with human-readable source code (<ie /> plain text), rather than using a <q>paint</q> program.  Any <latex /> macros used in the rest of your document may be employed in the <latex/>-standalone or Asymptote diagrams (with Sage graphics coming next?).</p>

                <idx><h>image</h><h><latex /> image</h></idx>

                <p>There are several graphics engine packages that a <latex /> document can employ. Code from these packages renders diagrams automatically as part of normal processing of <latex /> files.  For HTML output the <c>mbx</c> script produces SVG versions of the pictures.  The script can also produce standalone TEX source files, PDFs, PNGs, and EPSs. The packages should be loaded in <c>docinfo/latex-image-preamble</c>, which is also where global package settings should be made. If any ampersands occur in your <latex/> code you should use the <c>\amp</c> macro pre-defined by <pretext/>. These first examples are from the <url href="http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/">TeXample.net</url> site.</p>

                <p>A plot might use a graphics language to draw the axes and grid, but the data might be from an experiment and live in an external file that you do not wish to place in your source.  Place such a file in a subdirectory directly below the directory where your master source file resides.  In the example below <c>data</c> is the directory and <c>hodgkin-huxley-data.dat</c> is the file with the data points.  You <em>must</em> place the file in a subdirectory (it cannot reside next to your source file), but that directory may have subdirectories if you have many such files and want to organize them that way.  Then the <c>--include</c> command-line argument to the <c>mbx</c> script will manage the external files properly as it creates individual image files.</p>

                <p>It is still your responsibility to be sure this directory of external data files follows your <latex /> output to whatever directory you use to convert to a PDF and is in the right location for the relative path given in the XML source.  The discussion above only applies to generating individual image files, such as you would need for the HTML output.</p>

                <p>PSTricks is a <latex /> package for drawing diagrams and pictures, dating back to the days before <init>PDF</init>, when PostScript (<init>PS</init>) was king.  Given its history, it does not seem to work easily with the <c>pdflatex</c> engine.  But it will work easily with the <c>xelatex</c> engine.  We try to keep this present sample document workable with both engines, so we have presented an example of the use of PSTricks in the <c>xelatex</c>-exclusive sample document where we test obscure fonts and characters.  So your best bet is to look there.<idx>PSTricks</idx></p>

                <p>There are suggestions online that <cd>\usepackage[pdf]{pstricks}</cd>along with <cd>pdflatex --shell-escape *.tex</cd> is workable.  We could not make it happen, and a <q>shell escape</q> can be a dangerous security hole.  That said, updates to this approach are welcome.</p>

                <title>Placing Images without a Caption</title>

                <p>To place an image without a caption, use the <tag>sidebyside</tag> layout element, containing just a single <tag>image</tag>.  There is no way to add a caption, and the item will not be numbered.  You cannot cross-reference it, nor will it appear in a knowl in HTML output.  You will get a bit of vertical separation for the transitions to/from horizontal layout.  Use <c>margins=auto</c> on the <tag>sidebyside</tag> to center the image<mdash />this should become the default behavior.  A variety of other elements may be placed in a similar manner.  See Section<nbsp /><xref ref="section-side-by-side" /> to learn more about the <tag>sidebyside</tag> layout element.</p>

                <idx><h>Sage plots</h></idx>

                <p>Any of the numerous capabilities of Sage may be used to produce any graphics object, be it the simple graph of a single-variable function or some realization of a more complicated object.  All of the usual rules about formatting Sage code (esp. indentation) apply, along with one more caveat.  The last line of your Sage code <alert>must</alert> return a Sage <c>Graphics</c> object (or 3D plot).  The <c>mbx</c> script will isolate this last line, use it as the RHS of an assignment statement, and the Sage <c>.save()</c> method will be called to generate the image, which is either a Portable Document Format (PDF) file amenable to <latex /> output, or a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file amenable to HTML output.  For visualizations of 3D plots, Sage will only produce Portable Network Graphics (PNG) files, which can be included in HTML pages or <latex /> output.</p>

                <p>Pay careful attention to the requirement that the last line of your code be a graphics object.  In particular, while <c>show()</c> might appear to do the right thing, it evaluates to Python's <c>None</c> object and that is just what you will get.  The code for Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-sage-double-plot" /> illustrates creating two graphics objects and combining them into an expression on the last line that evaluates to a graphics object.</p>

                <title>Images from External Sources</title>

                <p>If you have raster images (photographs, etc) then they are specified with complete filenames, as above in Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-function-derivative" />.  If you have existing images that are vector graphics, then PDF format works best for <latex /> output and SVG format works best for HTML.  The utility <c>pdf2svg</c> works well for converting PDF to SVG.  In this case, specify your source as a filenmae, but leave off the file extension, and the appropriate version will be used for the current output format.</p>

                <p>The image below is provided from a PDF file for the <latex /> output, and was converted to an SVG for use with th HTML output.</p>

                <figure xml:id="figure-complete-graph">
                    <caption>Complete graph on <m>16</m> vertices, from <c>www.texample.net</c></caption>
                    <image source="images/complete-graph" width="65%"/>
                </figure>
            </subsection>

            <subsection>
                <title>Copies of Images</title>

                <p>Sometimes you want to use the same image more than once.  For a raster image, you can just point to it again.  You are free to wrap it in a <c>figure</c> or <c>sidebyside</c> and change the caption.  It will get a new number as a new figure, and you will need to assign a unique <c>@xml:id</c> attribute.  Maybe appending <c>-copy-2</c>, or similar, will be helpful.</p>

                <figure xml:id="figure-raster-image-copy">
                    <caption>Copy of raster image, in a figure, so now numbered and captioned</caption>
                    <image source="images/cross-square.png" width="30%" />
                </figure>

                <p>If you have a figure generated from source code (such as in TikZ) you can place the code into a file and <c>xinclude</c> it twice.  The <c>mbx</c> script will make two copies if you include the source twice, but with different names (generated from the different <c>@xml:id</c>).  Furthermore, with the <c>@parse</c> attribute on the <c>xinclude</c> element set to <c>text</c> you are absolved from escaping the dangerous XML characters (see <xref ref="subsection-xml-escape" text="type-global"/>) and definitely have no need for the often mis-understood <c>CDATA</c> mechanism.  We demonstrate this with the sample book, since it is all set up with the <c>xinclude</c> mechanism.  See the two plots of the 8-th roots of unity in the complex numbers section of the chapter on cyclic groups.</p>

                <title>Technical Details</title>

                <p>The table below is a summary of how graphics and images are specified, constructed and manipulated.  Additional processing is indicated by reference to the Python script <c>mbx</c>.  Images need to be placed relative to the <latex /> file that includes them during compilation, and placed relative to the <init>HTML</init> files which reference/include them.  Author-provided image files may be placed in any subdirectory, and the <c>@source</c> attribute should include the complete relative path with the subdirectory.  Files generated by the <c>mbx</c> script will be specified in the output using the relative directory <c>images</c>, which can be changed using the <c>directory.images</c> stringparam.  There is no reason author-provided files cannot also be placed in this same directory (presuming no duplicate names). [This table is presently more readable in HTML, the PDF version will improve.]</p>

                <p>In the early stages of a writing project, it may be best not to track provisional image files built with <c>mbx</c> under version control, and just regenerate them periodically (see the <c>-r</c> option for <c>mbx</c>).  As a project matures, then it makes sense to put stable files under version control for collaborators and others.  In every case, managing graphics files (and other aspects of production), is much more pleasurable with a script (shell, Makefile, etc.)</p>

                    <conclusion><p>This feature was designed with short <q>drill</q> exercises in mind.  With long exercises, or exercises with long hints, answers, or solutions, there is a risk that the <latex/> output will have bad page breaks in the vicinity (just before) such an exercise that occupies too much vertical space.  Edit, rearrange, or use fewer columns to see if the situation improves.</p></conclusion>

                <p>This section contains nested lists,
                   to demonstrate how they get assigned labels (numbering, symbols).
                   But we begin with two simple lists,
                   demonstrating an ordered list and an unordered list.
                   See the end of section for an example of a description list.
                   Note in the source the optional use of a paragraph
                   (<c>p</c>) for the list items of the list of colors.</p>

                <p><ol>
                    <li>First.</li>
                    <li>Second.</li>
                    <li>Third.</li>
                </ol><ul>
                    <li><p>Red</p></li>
                    <li><p>Green</p></li>
                    <li><p>Yellow</p></li>
                    <li><p>Purple</p></li>
                </ul></p>

                <p>Next, we have a list with no customization and multiple levels to test the defaults.  <latex /> allows a maximum of four levels of ordered/numbered lists, and a total of six levels if some unordered lists are mixed in.  The second-level defaults (lower-case Latin) are formatted slightly different in <latex /> versus HTML.  The HTML style is not easy to adjust, but you can specify the <latex /> version to match if it is important.Note that to have nested lists you <em>must</em> structure your list items as paragraphs, since a list may only appear within a <tag>p</tag> element.<ol>
                    <li><p>Level 1, first.</p></li>
                    <li xml:id="list-two">
                        <p>Level 1, second.<ol>
                            <li><p>Level 2, first.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Level 2, second.<ol>
                                <li><p>Level 3, first.</p></li>
                                <li xml:id="list-two-two-two"><p>Level 3, second.<ol>
                                    <li><p>Level 4, first.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Level 4, second.</p></li>
                                    <li xml:id="list-two-two-two-three"><p>Level 4, third.</p></li>
                                </ol></p>
                                </li>
                                <li><p>Level 3, third.</p></li>
                            </ol></p>
                            </li>
                            <li><p>Level 2, third.</p></li>
                        </ol></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Level 1, third.</p></li>
                </ol></p>

                <p>Items in ordered lists (only) may be be give an <c>xml:id</c> and then may be the target of an <c>xref</c>.  We test three here, referencing down into the hierarchy above.  Level 1, second: <xref ref="list-two" />.  Level 3, second: <xref ref="list-two-two-two" />.  Level 4, third: <xref ref="list-two-two-two-three" />.  Note that if a list item of an ordered list is contained within a list item of an unordered list, then its number will not be defined.</p>

                <p>And now a four-level deep unordered list with the default labels supplied by MBX (disc, circle, square, disc).  Again, the defalt order for Markdown/Jupyter (disc, square, circle, circle) is different than for <latex /> and HTML (disc, circle, square, disc)<ul>
                    <li><p>Level 1, first.</p></li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Level 1, second.<ul>
                            <li><p>Level 2, first.</p></li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Level 2, second.<ul>
                                    <li><p>Level 3, first.</p></li>

                                            <li><p>Level 4, second.</p></li>
                                            <li><p>Level 4, third.</p></li>
                                        </ul></p>

                    <li><p>Level 1, third.</p></li>
                </ul></p>

                <p>And a total of six levels with a mix of ordered and unordered lists, the most that out-of-the-box-<latex /> is able to handle.<ol>

                <p>Now, nested lists with the defaults replaced by custom choices.  First, an ordered list, three deep, upper Roman numerals, then upper-case Latin, then more traditional Arabic numerals on the three elements of the third level.

                <p>Exercises and References are specialized subdivisions you can put anywhere.  They are implemented as top-level lists, so should share behavior.  For example, an exercise may have many parts and when expressed as a list, should have the expected labels.</p>

                <p>Similarly, References may have lists in their annotations.  Unlikely?  But possible.</p>

                <p>The next two subdivisions are an Exercises subdivision and a References subdivision, which have lists within an exercise and a bibliographic item (respectively).</p>

                <title>Description Lists</title>

                <p>Use <c>dl</c> to make a description list<idx><h>description list</h></idx><idx><h>list</h><h>description</h></idx>. Inside of those tags, use <c>li</c> for each entry. Then, use <c>title</c> to specify the term being described and <c>p</c> to specify the description.</p>
                <p>A <q>description</q> list
                <idx><h>description list</h></idx><idx><h>list</h><h>description</h></idx>
                has a short term or phrase that is prominent, followed by a short description.  It is modeled on the lists of similar structure in both <latex /> and HTML.  It makes for a nice medium-weight way to define terms, somewhere in-between the <c>term</c> tag which just makes a term prominent in a sentence, and a <c>definition</c>, which is set off, has a heading, a number, and a title.  Do not try to manage the separation between the title and the description by employing punctuation (but you can include a question-mark or exclamation-point if necessary).  For example, do not include a colon to the end of the title.  This example is from Bob Plantz.

                <p>Some presentations can be assisted by a hint from the author about the lengths of the titles.

                <idx>named list</idx><idx><h>list</h><h>named</h></idx>

                <p>A list can be wrapped with a <tag>list</tag> element, so that it earns a number, can be given a title and have an introduction and conclusion.  Cross-references to individual list items get a bit involved as they are prefixed with the number of the list and then the number of the item, so conceivably you could get a number like <c>4.5.3:2.a.ii</c>.  The colon is used to indicate the transition from the number of the list within divisions and the numbers coming from the list hierarchy, since it has two small dots.</p>

                <list xml:id="list-colors-rainbow">
                    <caption>Colors of the Rainbow</caption>

                    <introduction>
                        <p>Because the colors are always in the same order, an ordered list is natural here.  The colors change continuously, but are often divided up into large ranges that human perception can easily distinguish.</p>
                    </introduction>

            <title>Table Calisthenics</title>

            <p>A very minimal table, hence with left-justified cells, no borders.  We do wrap the tabular element in a table element to get centering, numbering and a caption.</p>

            <table>
                <caption>Some Colors</caption>
                <tabular>
                    <row>

            </table>

            <p>Note that tables may be constructed using the <url href="http://www.latex-tables.com/"><latex /> Complex Table Editor</url> tool online at <c>latex-tables.com</c>and then exported in <pretext /> syntax.</p>

            <p>Tables can be used many ways.  We describe long division of polynomials by using vertical and horizontal borders on individual entries of a table.  The division lines are slightly thicker than the subtraction lines.  This is a good example of the typical abuse of tables for horizontal and vertical layout.  Also indicative of this abuse is that it might make more sense to call this a <q>Figure,</q> not a <q>Table</q>.</p>

            <p>The next table describes how to construct tables via the <c>tabular</c> element.  The <c>table</c> element may be used to enclose the raw table, so as to associate a caption and get vertical separation with horizontal centering.</p>

            <p>The <c>tabular</c> element contains a sequence of <c>row</c> elements, and must contain at least one.  Each <c>row</c> contains a sequence of <c>cell</c> elements and must have the same number in each row (acccounting for the use of the <c>colspan</c> attribute).  The contents of the <c>cell</c> elements are the text to appear in entries of the table.</p>

            <p>A sequence of <c>col</c> elements may optionally be used.  But if one appears, then there must be the right number for the width of the table.  They are empty elements always, and just carry information about their respective column.</p>

            <p>Where the body of the table below has an entry, it means the attribute may be used on the element, and affects the range of the tabular described by the element.  Employment of an attribute on elements to the right in the table will supersede use on elements to the left.  Generally, every cell has right and bottom borders, but only cells at the left side of the table have a left border and only cells across the top have a top border.  Only one cell has four borders.</p>

                <title>Bully Pulpit: Vertical Rules in Tables</title>

                <p>One of the goals of <pretext /> is to gently guide authors towards good choices in the design of their documents, even if we do not claim to know it all ourselves.  Take a close look at that table about tables.  What's missing?  No vertical rules.  Try living without them, you will not really miss them.  If you think you need to divide a table into two halves, maybe you really need two tables (and then see the <q>side-by-side</q> capabilities, Section <xref ref="section-side-by-side" />).</p>

                <p>In the documentation for his excellent <latex /> package, <url href="https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs">booktabs</url>, Simon Fear gives two rules for what he calls <q>formal tables</q>: (1) Never, ever use vertical rules, and (2) Never use double rules.  We have resisted the temptation to enforce the former and have provided an alternative to the second (three thicknesses).  He refers to using tables for layout as creating <q>tableau.</q>  If you are finicky about the look of your work, the first three pages of the documentation is recommended reading.</p>

                <p>That all said, we now give several examples in order to stress and demonstrate our code.</p>

In <latex /> output, figures, tables, listings and side-by-sides are <q>floats</q> whose placement can migrate, but we have tries to supress this behavior.  However, a float that is the first item of an <q>environment</q> (like a theorem or an example) can still float to a position <em>before</em> its title.  If that does not happen here, then our additional defenses are working.</p>

               <p>This example also checks that the total number of columns is correctly computed from the first row, which features several <c>colspan</c> attributes.</p>
           </example>

            <p>A bare minimum table (one row with one cell) to test edge cases:</p>

            <table xml:id="table-minimal">
                <caption>One entry table</caption>
                <tabular top="medium">
                    <row bottom="medium" left="minor">
                        <cell right="minor">One</cell>
                    </row>
                </tabular>
            </table>

            <p>Table cells with a fixed width where text wraps are known as <q>paragraph cells</q>. A cell will be created as a paragraph cell if and only if it has <tag>p</tag> children. And such cells should <em>only</em> have <tag>p</tag> children. The width of a paragraph cell is determined by a <c>width</c> attribute on the corresponding <tag>col</tag> (as a percentage). If no <c>width</c> is specified (or there isn't even a <tag>col</tag> in the first place) then <c>xsltproc</c> will abort. If the column has a non-paragraph cell with contents that are wider than the paragraph cells, results will be undesirable. There is presently no implementation for a paragraph cell that has a <c>colspan</c> greater than <m>1</m>, although cells with <c>colspan</c> greater than <m>1</m> that are above or below a paragraph cell will behave. Setting <c>width</c> on a <tag>col</tag> that has no paragraph cells may produce unexpected results. A <c>valign</c> for the parent <tag>row</tag> (or the ambient <tag>tabular</tag>) can control vertical alignment (top, middle, or bottom). A paragraph cell's <c>halign</c> attribute (left, center, right, or justify) controls how the text is justfied. Cells inherit <c>halign</c> from <tag>row</tag>, <tag>col</tag>, and <tag>tabular</tag> in that order of preference. In a non-paragraph cell where <c>halign='justify'</c>, the horizontal alignment will match the behavior of <c>halign='left'</c>.</p>

            <p>Table cells can have multiline content using <tag>line</tag> elements. This is not the same thing as a paragraph cell<mdash />line breaking will happen precisely where the author tells it to. A <tag>line</tag> will not break, even on a narrow screen. If a cell uses a <tag>line</tag>, it must only use a sequence of <tag>line</tag>s and no other content. As with paragraph cells, you can use a <c>valign</c> attribute for the row.</p>

            <p>Tables are formed in <latex /> output with copious use of the <c>\multicolumn</c> macro to override more global alignment settings, and to spread the content of one cell across several columns.  However, sometimes <latex />'s special characters have behaved badly in this situation.  So the table below, two items per row, is just designed for <latex /> testing.  But of course, it should still render fine in other formats.  The three test cases are from <xref ref="section-urls" />, but without 50 alphabetic characters and 8 digits, which should not be problems in this context.  In order to test the use of a percent sign (<c>%</c>) in a URL, we follow it by two hex digits, specifically, <c>58</c>, which is a way to represent the character <c>X</c> in a <init>URL</init>.  The first column's entries are <em>forced</em> to be wrapped in a <c>\multicolumn</c> by specifying their horizontal alignment.  The second column's entries <em>will not</em> be wrapped in a <c>\multicolumn</c>.So the two columns will look identical, other than the first having a left alignment, and the second has the default center alignment.  (This table is known to render poorly in a Jupyter notebook.  The cause is four dollar signs present in rows 1 and 3, and is explained in <xref ref="subsection-jupyter-dollars" text="type-global"/>.)</p>

            <introduction>
                <!-- First paragraph duplicated in next section -->
                <p>When outputting Web page versions, it is possible to embed a variety of dynamic interactive elements.  In a <latex />/PDF version, these will necessarily need to be replaced by some static substitute, such as a screenshot.  See <xref ref="section-sage-cells" text="type-global" /> for the specifics of embedding instances of the Sage Cell Server, which is more elaborate, and not entirely similar.</p>

                <p>Interactives in this section are those for which you provide code you have authored.  Generally, the libraries involved to support this have open licenses, though the player for GeoGebra may be an exception.  Creating these assumes some familiarity with <init>HTML</init> and Javascript.  See <xref ref="section-interactive-server" text="type-global" /> for more interactives that are perhaps simpler to create or use.</p>

                <title>HTML5 Canvas</title>

                <p><init>HTML5</init> introduced the <tag>canvas</tag> element, which can be thought of a blank slate, a place to draw or write on.  So <pretext /> has the <tag>slate</tag> element for a similar purpose.  Generally, but not exclusively, <init>HTML5</init> writes on a <tag>canvas</tag> using the Javascript language.  We demonstrate this approach to interactive diagrams in this subsection.</p>

                <p>The following examples are from David Austin's excellent <url href="http://merganser.math.gvsu.edu/david/linear.algebra/ula/index.html"><pubtitle>Understanding Linear Algebra</pubtitle></url> textbook, which can be found at <cd>
                    <cline>merganser.math.gvsu.edu/david/linear.algebra/ula/index.html</cline>
                </cd>David's contribution of examples, and assistance designing the <pretext /> elements is greatly appreciated.  Alright, let's learn some linear algebra.  Yes, there are some learning opportunities in this subsection.</p>

The four entries of the matrix <m>A</m> are coded into the interactive.  Can you deduce <m>A</m> simply by using the interactive?  Which theorem is the key?</p>

                <idx>D3.js</idx>

                <p><term>D3</term> is a Javascript library for <q>Data-Driven Documents</q>, which might greatly enhance some data you wish to display.  In short, it uses the animation capabilities of <init>SVG</init>.  Available examples seem sensitive to the version of the library, so we have examples using different versions.  Use the <attr>version</attr> attribute on <tag>interactive</tag> to specify the version number.  The default is <c>5</c>.</p>

                <p>The first example uses the force layout and collision detection from Version 3.  (The necessary commands are very different in Version 4.)  Pretend you are a working shepherding dog.  Can you separate, and catch, one of the herd?</p>

                <p>Similar, but different, this demonstration of a graph layout uses Version 4 of the library.  Technical notes:<ul>
                    <li>We have changed the size of the nodes, and their number, to fit in a smaller space.</li>
                    <li>The Javascript script uses introspection to size itself, which would be a good general practice.</li>

                    <p>This visualisation uses a D3 force simulation to show the Twitter relationships between the Assembly Members in the Welsh Assembly in terms of the number of times each assembly member has mentioned another assembly member in a tweet.</p>

                    <p>Twitter relationships were mined on 22/03/2017, and are representative of the conversational relationships on that date. Links between AMs represent a conversational relationship: one AM has mentioned the other. Party colour indicates the direction of the mention.</p>

                    <p>Hover over the nodes to fade out non-connected nodes.</p>

                    <p>Rather than using intermediate nodes to create curved links (as in Mike Bostock's block), this adds curves by adding a calculated control point for each edge.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Technical notes:<ul>
                    <li>Once the nodes organize themselves (automatically in the beginning), they cannot be moved.</li>
                    <li>We have adjusted the margins in an attempt to keep names visible on the right side, but without giving up too much space.</li>
                    <li>We have adjust the repelling force, and the collision buffer, to better fit the available space.</li>
                    <li>This example required its own <init>CSS</init>, which we have included as part of the <tag>interactive</tag>.</li>
                    <li>The data collected from the Twitter analysis is contained in a <init>JSON</init> file, <c>mention_network.json</c>, and where the script loads that file, it needs a path relative to the <init>HTML</init> file where the interactive is viewed.</li>

                <p>Entirely similar to using an HTML5 <c>canvas</c> element (<xref ref="interactive-html5-canvas" />), it is possible to control an <init>SVG</init> element with Javascript.  This example is from Mark McClure.</p>

                <p>Look carefully at the source and rendering of this example as <init>HTML</init>.  The change in <m>x</m>, denoted here as <m>h</m>, is reported when the <q>Show secant line</q> option is ticked.  The <m>h</m> is being rendered as mathematics by the Javascript MathJax library.  However, this cannot be accomplished with <c>$...$</c> nor by <c>\(...\)</c>, but instead by using <tag>script</tag> tags that MathJax recognizes.  So the employment of MathJax here is accomplished with<cd>

                <idx>JSXGraph</idx>

                <p><url href="http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/index.html">JSXGraph</url> is a <q>cross-browser JavaScript library for interactive geometry, function plotting, charting, and data visualization in the web browser.</q>  Now a <tag>slate</tag> will be what JSXGraph calls a <term>board</term>.  Again, you use Javascript to write onto a <tag>slate</tag>, but have some powerful shortcuts available from the JSXGraph library.  For this reason, <pretext /> calls JSXGraph a <q>language</q>, similar in may respects to how Sage is a language, but is really a Python library.  So realize that the syntax for using JSXGraph is that of Javascript.</p>

                <p>Place Javascript inside a file that is specified with the <attr>source</attr> attribute of the <tag>interactive</tag> element.  Then just be certain that <attr>xml:id</attr> of the <tag>interactive</tag> element is passed as the <init>HTML</init> <c>id</c> in an (early) call to JSXGraph's <c>initBoard()</c> method.</p>

                <p>The plot below is the curve <m>r=a+b\theta</m> in polar coordinates, for <m>0\leq\theta\leq 8\pi</m>.  It may be manipulated with the sliders to control the shape of the curve.  Point <m>A</m> is contrained to the curve, but may be dragged to a new location. At <m>A</m> the tangent line and normal line are plotted as dashed red lines.  Use the controls in the lower left to adjust the viewing window.  This <url href="http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/Archimedean_spiral">example</url> is taken from the JSXGraph <url href="http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/Category:Examples">example wiki</url>.  The code could be written in 7 lines.  Width is 80% and aspect ratio is 4:3.</p>

                            <p>Drag the sliders to change the parameters <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.  Controls in the lower-right will adjust the viewing window.</p>

                <p>Here is a more elaborate example, from the <url href="http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/showcase/">JSXGraph Showcase</url>, titled <url href="http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/showcase/infinity.html">Infinity</url>.</p>

                <p>There are two active sliders to control the shape and shading of the graphic, and hovering the mouse near one of the edges will highlight the entirety of one of the 30 quadrangles.  Finally, each of the four red corners may be dragged to a new location.  Code is 47 lines.  Width is 60% and aspect ratio is the default, 1:1, <ie /> a square.</p>

                <figure>

                <p>Here are the two new examples.  They have been included in a <c>sidebyside</c> layout element with equal widths (see <xref ref="section-side-by-side" text="type-global" />) so they can be placed horizontally across the page.  They are not wrapped as figures, so cannot be cross-referenced.  These are again from the <url href="http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wiki/index.php/Category:Examples">example wiki</url>, the left being Fermat's Spiral and the right being a demonstration of B-splines.</p>

                <p>Generally, we load an interactive into an HTML <c>iframe</c> to sandbox (isolate) it from other interactives.  We does this for your own protection.  So, for example, one interactive cannot talk to another.  If two <tag>slate</tag> need to communicate, then they are related, and should be placed into a single <tag>interactive</tag>, allowed to layout themselves, or grouped within a <tag>sidebyside</tag> allowing finer control.

                <idx><h>Sage</h><h>interacts</h></idx>

                <p>Sage, and the Sage Cell Server, support interactive demonstrations, called <term>interacts</term>.<ul>
                    <li>The interactive elements are nearly trivial to construct.</li>
                    <li>An interact is simply a single Python function (acted on by a decorator).</li>
                    <li>You have the full mathematical power of Sage at your disposal, so can do some very powerful computations with high precision (or exactly).</li>
                    <li>The interface is not as polished as what you can achieve with Javascript libraries.</li>
                    <li>Graphics refresh with a round-trip to the server, so are not nearly as fluid as with other tools.</li>
                </ul>  Note that each interact is insulated from the others, unlike our other employment of the Sage Cell Server.</p>

                <p>This example is by Marshall Hampton, taken from the Sage interact wiki, <url href="https://wiki.sagemath.org/interact/calculus"><c>wiki.sagemath.org/interact/calculus</c></url>, specifically <url href="https://wiki.sagemath.org/interact/calculus#Numerical_integrals_with_the_midpoint_rule">here</url>.</p>

                <title>Geogebra</title>

                <p>To embed a GeoGebra applet as-is from GeoGebra's Classroom Resources site (by material ID), see <xref ref="subsection-geogebra-server" text="type-global"/>. To design your own applet (either from scratch, or modifying something that already exists in one of those three forms) you may use one of Geogebra's <q>Apps</q> to embed the material in your document. (But note, use of the App comes with licensing restrictions.) <pretext /> will handle most of the technical details for you.</p>

                <p>Do one of the following:<ol>
                    <li>Identify a material ID from GeoGebra's Classroom Resources site. You might even make the material yourself on that site.</li>
                    <li>Obtain a <c>.ggb</c> file from GeoGebra. You might construct something on a desktop installation of GeoGebra and save it. If you have a base64-encoded string for a GeoGebra applet, but you don't have a <c>.ggb</c> file, you can decode the string and save the result. For example, at <url href="https://www.opinionatedgeek.com/codecs/base64decoder">www.opinionatedgeek.com/codecs/base64decoder</url>.</li>
                    <li>Obtain a base64 encoded string for a GeoGebra applet. You might first open a <c>.ggb</c> file in a desktop installation of GeoGebra, and push ctrl-shift-B (command-shift-B on a Mac) and then the string will be in your clipboard.</li>
                    <li>None of the above, with the intention to make an applet from scratch.</li>
                </ol></p>

                <p>Then mimic the examples that follow, using GeoGebra API commands documented at <url href="https://wiki.geogebra.org/en/Reference:GeoGebra_Apps_API">wiki.geogebra.org/en/Reference:GeoGebra_Apps_API</url>, but do not include the <c>ggbApplet.</c> or <c>applet.</c> used in examples to prefix the functions<emdash/>that part of the code will be provided automatically by <pretext/>.</p>

                <p>Jack Green created an applet on the Classroom Resources site with ID <c>D4s2v4ft</c>, which you may view at <url href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/D4s2v4ft">geogebra.org/m/D4s2v4ft</url>. Suppose you would like to use this in your project, but change something about it. We will change something trivial, making the <m>y</m>-axis ticks be separated <m>5</m> apart instead of <m>10</m> apart. We also decide we want a different aspect ratio and overall width. One gotcha: the original applet is loaded and then <pretext/> uses <attr>width</attr> and <attr>aspect</attr> attributes to resize the viewing window using the top left corner as an anchor. This does not rescale axes and that may leave you with important elements missing from the viewing window. So here we reset the viewing window to return to values that are in the original. Lastly, we disable zooming, which is not helpful for this applet. To do each of these things, we rely on the GeoGebra API manual at <url href="https://wiki.geogebra.org/en/Reference:GeoGebra_Apps_API">wiki.geogebra.org/en/Reference:GeoGebra_Apps_API</url>. It is important to use one command per line.</p>

                    </interactive>
                </figure>

                <p>The same can be done with a <c>.ggb</c> file. Here we use two provided by David Rosoff, and one provided by Tevian Dray. The path to the file needs to be relative. We modify David's applet in a few ways. Remove the modifications to see the original.</p>

                <p>You could also use a base64-encoded string of the <c>.ggb</c> file. You might come across such a string somewhere, or you might generate one by opening a <c>.ggb</c> file in a desktop installation of GeoGebra, and pushing ctrl-shift-B (command-shift-B on a Mac) to get the string in your clipboard. If you do this, you could use a <attr>base64</attr> attribute in place of the <attr>source</attr> attribute in the previous example. We don't do that here because such a string is generally over 5000 characters long and we are keeping the sample article source a bit cleaner.</p>

                <p>Lastly, you may just wish to build something from scratch using GeoGebra API. Note that for accessibilty reasons, some objects are rendered unselectable with the <c>setFixed</c> command. Perhaps this should have been done with the previous examples, but that is more difficult when you do not know all of their names.</p>

            <introduction>
                <!-- First paragraph duplicated in previous section -->
                <p>When outputting Web page versions, it is possible to embed a variety of dynamic interactive elements.  In a <latex />/PDF version, these will necessarily need to be replaced by some static substitute, such as a screenshot.  See <xref ref="section-sage-cells" text="type-global" /> for the specifics of embedding instances of the Sage Cell Server, which is more elaborate, and not entirely similar.</p>

                <p>Interactives in this section have code that lives on a server somewhere (in the <q>cloud</q>).  So maybe you uploaded an interactive demonstration, or maybe somebody else did.  In this sense, these are easier to create or use.  But pay attention, the code may come with restrictive licenses, even if you are the author originally.  See <xref ref="section-interactive-authored" text="type-global" /> for more interactives that can be free as in <q>freedom</q> or <foreign xml:lang="fr-FR">liberté</foreign>.  CalcPlot3D is the notable exception here.</p>

                <p>(2018-06-22) Almost everything in this section is under active development and not stable yet.  Feel free to experiment and make suggestions and requests.  This page takes a while to completely load, so be patient.</p>

                <p>A Geogebra <term>material</term> is something you might use in a class.  It could also be called an interactive demonstration.  Go browsing at <url href="https://www.geogebra.org/materials/">www.geogebra.org/materials</url> and find something appropriate for your project.  Or make an account and create your own.</p>

                <p>Once you find a material that looks instructive, it will be at a <init>URL</init> such as<cd>https://www.geogebra.org/m/KGn2d4Qd</cd> and you want to pick off the identifier on the end, in this case <c>KGn2d4Qd</c>.  Then author<cd>&lt;interactive geogebra="KGn2d4Qd" /&gt;</cd>  At this writing (2018-02-04) you will want to place this inside a <c>figure</c>, with a caption, as we do right now with material <c>KGn2d4Qd</c>.</p>

                <p>The shape of the material will be fixed, so guess (or measure with an on-screen ruler), the aspect ratio and use that in the <tag>interactive</tag> element.</p>

                <title>Desmos Graphs</title>
                <idx>Desmos graphs</idx>

                <p><term>Desmos</term> provides interactive graphing applications.  The following example was created by Ann Cary and made available via the <q>Share</q> function of Desmos.  You can make your own Desmos graph, choose the <q>Share</q> icon, and the <q>Embed</q> option, to get a <init>URL</init> such as <cd>https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ttox1bvxku</cd>  You want to pick off the identifier on the end, in this case <c>ttox1bvxku</c>, then author<cd>&lt;interactive desmos="ttox1bvxku" width="60%" aspect="2:3" /&gt;</cd> as we have done here.</p>

                <p>The static image employed in the <latex /> version of this article was obtained by viewing the graph at the Desmos site (<ie />, not the embedded version in the <pretext /> HTML version), and using the Share button to export a <init>PNG</init> image.  In this case, we used a <q>Medium Rectangle</q> and <q>Thick</q> lines.</p>

                <title>CalcPlot3D</title>
                <idx>CalcPlot3D</idx>

                <p>CalcPlot3D is a Javascript application for creating, visualizing, and understanding plots of 3D surfaces.  So it would be an ideal companion to a book on multivariate calculus, but should be useful in other courses of study.</p>

                <p>To use it, find the <url href="http://www.monroecc.edu/faculty/paulseeburger/calcnsf/CalcPlot3D/">online app version</url> at<cd>http://www.monroecc.edu/faculty/paulseeburger/calcnsf/CalcPlot3D/</cd>Create a plot and adjust the image to a viewpoint and scale you like.  Then, click the menu icon in the upper-left and choose <c>File</c>.  From here you can save a <init>PNG</init> image for the static version, but you also want to select <c>Encode View in URL</c>.  Now your browser address bar is filled with a query string (<em>all</em> the stuff <em>after</em> the question-mark) that has all the information necessary to reproduce your plot (and view).  Copy everything after the first question-mark to the <c>interactive/code</c> element.  Be sure to replace any ampersands by <c>&amp;amp;</c> (see the Author's Guide for more about certain characters in <init>URL</init>s).  Examine the source for the examples below to see how they are authored.</p>

                <p>In <xref ref="figure-intersecting-planes" text="type-global"/> grab the image with your mouse and rotate it in various directions.  Then while the image has focus, press the <c>3</c> key (short for <q>3-D</q>), to get a 3D view, which will require some red-blue 3D glasses to fully appreciate.  Press the key again to return to a regular view.</p>

                <idx>Wolfram CDF</idx>

                <p>You can embed interactive demonstrations created in Wolfram's <term>Computable Document Format</term> so that they will be played with the Wolfram CDF Player<trademark />.  Once you create and save a demonstration, you want to determine the UUID that is the identifier of your demonstration.  For example, <xref ref="wolfram-cdf-cellular-automata" text="type-global" /> is identified by <c>9fa2acff-c809-4b7f-a73b-c59ace36affc</c>.  This identifier is enough to create the <pretext /> to embed the demonstration.  See <url href="https://reference.wolfram.com/language/howto/DeployInteractiveContentInTheWolframCloud.html" /> for information about creating your demonstration.</p>

                <p><url href="http://www.wolfram.com/cdf/adopting-cdf/deploying-cdf/web-delivery-cloud.html" /> explains hosting CDF files at the Wolfram Cloud, and is the source of <xref ref="wolfram-cdf-cellular-automata" text="type-global" />.  You can learn about powering your CDF with Wolfram Cloud Credits at <url href="https://www.wolfram.com/cloud-credits/" />.

            <title>Video</title>

            <p>First, a gratuitous reference to Exercise<nbsp /><xref ref="exercises-cosine-derivative" /> about the derivative of a cosine.</p>

            <p>You can specify a video by a filename if you host it as part of your document, or a <init>URL</init> giving a location on the Internet.  There are a few extra features for YouTube videos, which are near the bottom of this page, so look there first if that meets your needs.</p>

            <p>Embedded videos can make sense for a web version of your document. This is a video promoting the University of Puget Sound to potential new students, in WebM format.  Support is limited to HTML5-capable browsers.  The file format can be MP4, Ogg, or WebM, though this may vary depending upon the browser.  Use a <tag>video</tag> element, within either a <tag>figure</tag> (numbered, captioned) or a <tag>sidebyside</tag> for more precise control.   The <attr>source</attr> attribute in this first example <em>does not</em> include an extension, and so three possibilities above will be searched for preferentially (you need only provide the video in one format, but providing additional versions will increase the chances every browser will find a compatible format).</p>

            <figure>
                <caption>University of Puget Sound Promotional Video</caption>
                <video source="images/ups-visitor-guide-360" width="80%" preview="images/ups-promo-frame-one.jpg" />
            </figure>

            <p>You can replace the <q>preview</q> image of a video with one of your own making.  <init>HTML</init> refers to this as the <term>poster</term>, presumably because it advertises the video.  The image you make should be of the same quality as the video, and with the same aspect-ratio, and is presumably one of the frames of the video.  So a screenshot is the likely avenue.  (Maybe we will have advice on how to do this easily, or see <url href="https://github.com/rbeezer/mathbook/issues/853" />.)
        <idx><h>link</h><h>external, url</h></idx>
        <idx><h>reference</h><h>external, url</h></idx>
        On the <tag>video</tag> tag, include a <attr>preview</attr> attribute which is the name of an image file, including a relative path.  (JPEG or PNG formats are best.  JPEG may be smaller for video screenshots, while PNG is lossless and so may work better for diagrams.)</p>

            <figure>
                <caption>University of Puget Sound Promotional Video</caption>
                <video source="images/ups-visitor-guide-360" width="80%" preview="images/ups-promo-preview.jpg" />
            </figure>

            <p>If you find the posters distracting or objectionable, you can cover them up by requesting a generic poster with the attribute-value pair: <c>preview = "generic"</c>.</p>

            <figure>
                <caption>University of Puget Sound Promotional Video</caption>
                <video source="images/ups-visitor-guide-360" width="80%" preview="generic" />
            </figure>

            <p>You can use a very similar construction to point to a video hosted somewhere on the Internet, just use a complete <init>URL</init> for the <tag>source</tag> attribute.  Note that if the URL has a query string (parameters following a question-mark), then any ampersands (&amp;) will need to be escaped, so as to not confuse the <init>XML</init> processor (<ie /> use <c>&amp;amp</c>).  Also, the question-mark character needs to <em>not</em> be <init>URL</init>-encoded (<c>%3F</c>), so presumably edit the <init>URL</init> to be the character.  Here are two examples, the second one uses the <attr>start</attr> and <attr>stop</attr> attributes to limit the video to just the time between the 16-second and 30-second locations.</p>

            <p>YouTube<idx><h>YouTube videos</h></idx><idx><h>videos</h><h>YouTube</h></idx> videos may be embedded with only knowledge of a video's <q>ID</q> or a <q>playlist ID</q>.  A single video's YouTube ID is a string of eleven seemingly random characters that show up in the URL when you watch a video.  For the Led Zeppelin performance below, the ID is <c>hAzdgU_kpGo</c>, which you might normally watch directly from the URL <url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAzdgU_kpGo" />.  Screen real estate is determined by specifying an optional <c>@width</c> attribute as a percentage, and aspect ratio is preserved on the assumption of HD video (16:9).  (Enhancements will include other aspect ratios.)</p>

            <p>If you have ever owned a drone, you sympathize with this guy.  Way funnier than a cat video.</p>

            <p>If you are only interested in a piece of the action, you can limit the video with <c>start</c> and <c>end</c> attributes in seconds.  You might make those times clear in the caption for readers getting the link out of a PDF.  Some videos may not respect these parameters.</p>

            <p>Videos may be placed <q>standalone</q> in a <tag>sidebyside</tag>, but are designed mostly on the assumption that they are wrapped in a <c>figure</c> with a <c>title</c> (which is distinct from a <c>caption</c>).  This video comes with a deafult poster featuring Robert Plant.  We've replaced it with Jimmy Page.</p>

            <p>We can pack two videos side-by-side, with a lot of horizontal control, using two panels in the <c>sidebyside</c> element.  We have simply chose not to provide a caption (overall, or separately) as an illustration.  The sizes are purposely a bit odd.  See <xref ref="section-side-by-side" text="type-global" /> for much more on side-by-side panels.  These videos come from the <q>Topic</q> and <q>VEVO</q> areas of YouTube (respectively) and both have start/end times.</p>

        Various author tools are planned.  Note the embedded "todo"
        elements above.  An XSL transform in-testing will extract them
        for a report, and they are hidden in actual output.
        For a cross-reference, instead of a "ref" atrribute,
        you can use a "provisional" attribute while writing, which is
        especially useful for unknown forward references.  This is
        included in the author report also.
        A "preview" XSL transform to HTML could be especially useful.

        <section xml:id="section-cross-referencing">
            <title>Cross-Referencing</title>

            <p>Cross-references<idx>cross-reference</idx> are easy, since that is a key reason for having a highly structured document.  Here is a useful feature if you elect to use it.  Any <tag>xref</tag> will <q>know</q> what it points to, so you can let it provide the <q>naming</q> part of the cross-reference text.  You can turn this on globally with the command-line parameter <c>autoname</c><idx><h>autoname</h></idx> set to <c>'yes'</c>.  If you do that, you will see most of the names in this document doubled, since the names are written into the source already in most places outside of this section.  Try it and see: use <c>--stringparam autoname 'yes'</c> as an argument to <c>xsltproc</c>.</p>

            <p>Moreover, the names themselves will change with the use of the one language dependent file.  And another bonus is that with an autoname, you automatically get a <em>non-breaking</em> space between the name and the reference.  The autoname switch makes no sense for <q>provisional</q> cross-references, since there is no information about what they point to.</p>

            <p>Here is a reference that has no indication of its type in the source:  <xref ref="theorem-FTC" />.  So by default you will just see a number that you can click on.  If you use the <c>text="type-global"</c> switch then you should see <q>Theorem</q> prepended.  Note that if you changed the theorem to a lemma, then that change would be reflected here automatically when autonaming is in effect.</p>

            <p>If you set the autonaming behavior globally, or accept the default behavior, there will still be instances where you want to override that choice.  Simple: just say <c>text="type-global"</c> or <c>text="global"</c> as part of the <c>xref</c>.  Each example below should look the same each time this article is processed, no matter how the global <c>autoname</c> is set.<ul>
                <li><p>No name ever: <xref ref="corollary-FTC-derivative" text="global" /></p></li>
                <li><p>Always named: <xref ref="corollary-FTC-derivative" text="type-global" /></p></li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>You might also wish to provide a prefix to a cross-reference and have it incorporated into the text of what you would click on in an electronic version.  So if you make an <c>xref</c> with some content, then that content will prefix the cross-reference within the clickable/pokeable text and be attached with a non-breaking space.  This <c>xref</c> content totally overrides any prefix that might happen otherwise.  So the name of an item (<eg /> <q>corollary</q>) could be replaced, and if you make a cross-reference with a title as the clickable, then that text can be replaced also.  An example:<ul>
                <li><p>A grand result: <xref ref="corollary-FTC-derivative">Major Corollary</xref></p></li>
                <li><p>A grand result: <xref ref="corollary-FTC-derivative" text="title">a nice corollary</xref></p></li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>Suppose you want to reference two theorems, so you might want to say something like <q>Theorems 4.6 and 5.2.</q>  With global autonaming on, you can override the first <c>Theorem</c> by providing the content <c>Theorems</c> on the first <c>xref</c> and <c>text="global"</c> on the second <c>xref</c>.  (With global autonaming off, you will also get what you want/expect.)   Here is the test, which should look correct no matter what the global switch is:  <xref ref="section-cross-referencing">Sections</xref> and <xref ref="section-internationalization" text="global" />.  (But notice that it is up to you to be certain the types of these targets do not change without you changing the content of the first <c>xref</c>.  The <q>author-tools</q> mode and careful choices of <c>xml:id</c> strings can help avoid this trap.)</p>

            <p>One final twist.  If you say <c>text="title"</c>, then the title you assigned to the theorem will prefix the number.  Here is a the final example, which should always refer to a fundamental theorem by name <xref ref="theorem-FTC" text="title" />.</p>

            <p>Cross-references to exercises with hard-coded numbers should respect the supplied number.  Exercise<nbsp /><xref ref="exercise-with-hardcoded-number" /> should reference problem 42a.</p>

            <p>Here we form a list to test pointing at various structures.  Each of the following should open a knowl in the HTML version, otherwise it will be a traditional hyperlink (if possible).  Note that if a knowl opens, there will always be an <q>in-context</q> link which will take you to the actual location, should you have  wished instead to just go there.<ul>

                <li><p>A cross-reference to a <tag>solutions</tag> division in a subsection, which should not be numbered where born, but which has the number of its parent division in a cross-reference: <xref ref="solutions-subsection" text="type-global"/>.

                <li><p>A cross-reference to an <tag>exercises</tag> division in a subsection, which is the only such division in that subsection and therefore should not be numbered where born, but which has the number of its parent division in a cross-reference: <xref ref="exercises-subsection-solo" text="type-global"/>.  In contrast we cross-reference an <tag>exercises</tag> division which is one of two inside a section, and therefore is numbered, when born and when cross-referenced, in continuity with the preceding subsections: <xref ref="exercises-section-multiple" text="type-global"/>.</p></li>

            </ul></p>

            <p>Cross-references to structural elements of the document will always take you there directly, since even in the HTML version these parts never get realized as knowls.  You will find such links sprinkled through this document, but here is an autonamed link to a subsubsection:  <xref ref="subsubsection-different-integrals" text="type-global" />.</p>

            <p>Cross-references can be built into display mathematics, but they can only point to one item (<ie /> a comma-delimited list of targets is not supported).  Examples below should test the distinction in HTML output between a link that opens a knowl and a link that jumps to a larger chunk of content.  Notice that display mathematics is entirely <latex /> syntax, no matter which output format you create.  So if you do not use the <c>autoname</c> facility, you need to wrap non-math text in <c>\text{}</c> and perhaps use a tilde (<c>~</c>) as a non-breaking space (examine the source of this article).</p>

            <p><md>
                <mrow>x^2 + y^2 &amp;= z^2&amp;&amp;<xref ref="theorem-FTC" text="type-global" /></mrow>
                <mrow>a^2 + b^2 &amp;= c^2&amp;&amp;\text{Section}~<xref ref="section-fundamental-theorem" /></mrow>
            </md></p>

            <p>Variations on the above include multiple <c>xml:id</c> as the value of a single <c>ref</c> attribute on an <c>xref</c>, in the form of a comma-separated list.  In this case, only the numbers are links/knowls and the autonaming attribute is based on the type of the first <c>ref</c>.  Wrapping with brackets (citations) or parentheses (equations) is also controlled by the type of the first <c>ref</c>.  And the <c>detail</c> attribute for a bibliographic reference is silently ignored.  So you can do silly things like have a reference to a theorem within a list of equation numbers and there will be no error message.  Handle with care.  Spaces after commas in the list will migrate to the output as spaces, so if you don't have any, you won't get any.<ul>
                <li><p>Three theorems, with spaces, autonamed: <xref ref="theorem-FTC, theorem-number-01, theorem-number-03" text="type-global"/></p></li>
                <li><p>Two equations, no spaces, autonamed: <xref ref="equation-alternate-FTC,equation-use-FTC" text="type-global"/></p></li>
                <li><p>Two bibliographic items, no autoname: <xref ref="biblio-judson-AATA, biblio-lay-article" /></p></li>
                <!-- <li><p>: <xref ref="" /></p></li> -->
            </ul></p>

            <p>If you have a long list of items (such as homework exercises, not in an <c>exercisegroup</c>, or perhaps several chapters), you can get a cross-reference that prints as a range by using <c>xref</c> with two attributes <c>first</c> and <c>last</c>, which may contain a single <c>xml:id</c> each.  As with multiple references, <c>first</c> will control autonaming and other features.<ul>
                <li><p>A range of exercises, autonamed (this range appears <q>out-of-order</q> since the two <c>exercise</c> are numbered under two different schemes): <xref first="exercise-essay" last="exercise-test-number" text="type-global"/></p></li>
                <li><p>A range of equations: <xref first="equation-use-FTC" last="equation-conclude" /></p></li>
                <li><p>A system of equations, given as range from first to last: <xref first="equation-system-begin" last="equation-system-end" /></p></li>
                <li><p>A range of sections, hand-named to be plural: Sections<nbsp /><xref first="section-sage-cells" last="section-cross-referencing" /></p></li>
                <li><p>A range of bibliographic items: <xref first="biblio-judson-AATA" last="biblio-lay-article" /></p></li>

            <p>Supporting a multitude of possible characters, across many languages and across many output formats can be a challenge.  One of our goals is to make this much easier for authors.  Fortunately, the Unicode standard has led to improvements from the 7-bit ASCII standard of old.</p>

            <paragraphs>
                <title>Unicode Characters for HTML Output</title>

                <p>First, we discuss HTML output.  If you include Unicode<idx>Unicode</idx> characters in your <pretext /> source, they should survive just fine <foreign xml:lang="fr-FR">en route</foreign> to a web browser or e-reader.  Here are the caveats for HTML output:<ul>
                    <li><p>So that you can continue to get the best results with print and PDF output, use available empty elements for obscure characters, even if targeting HTML output, before resorting to a Unicode character.  For example, use <tage>copyright</tage> for the copyright symbol in text before resorting to the Unicode character <c>U+00A9</c>.  It is a bit more work, but you will get better results with other conversions, even if you initially are only fascinated by <init>HTML</init>.</p></li>

                    <li><p>How you actually enter Unicode characters into your source file is dependent on your editor and operating system, and is therefore outside the scope of our documentation.  You can cut-and-paste characters and text from the source of our examples for initial testing and experimentation.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Always, always identify your source as having Unicode characters by including the incantation <tag>?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?</tag> as the first line of your source file. (You <em>may</em> be able to accurately cut-and-paste this version here.  But if the copy has non-standard characters in it, go back to the top of this source file for a copy.)</p></li>

                    <li><p>Alan Wood’s <url href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/unicode_samples.html">Unicode Resources</url> has a plethora of samples of various groups of Unicode characters.  If you, or your readers, are <q>missing</q> characters in a web browser, this is a good place to start testing the local setup.</p></li>

                <title>Characters in <latex/>, PDF, print</title>

                <p>The situation for <latex/> is a bit more complicated, since <tex/> pre-dates Unicode's widespread adoption.</p>

                <p>This sample article is intended to work well, out-of-the-box, for authors just starting with <pretext/>.  So we only include here examples that we know are likely to convert to <init>PDF</init> without any errors.  For more extensive examples and experiments, we provide the sample document <c>examples/fonts/fonts-and-characters.xml</c>, so be aware of that example as you look to see what is possible.</p>

                <p>Similarly, you should be able to process this sample article successfully with various <latex/> engines.  We test regularly with <c>pdflatex</c> and <c>xelatex</c> and provide online sample PDF output of this document processed by <c>pdflatex</c>.  In principle, you should be able to use <c>latex</c> (to produce a DVI), and possibly other (unsupported) engines, such as <c>lualatex</c>.</p>

                <p>Once you get beyond the Latin alphabet, with accents common in Western Europe and the Western Hemisphere, you will almost assuredly need to restrict your attention to producing <init>PDF</init> output with the <c>xelatex</c> engine.  This is discussed and tested in <c>examples/fonts/fonts-and-characters.xml</c>.</p>

                <title>Basic Latin, <c>U+0000</c><ndash /><c>U+007F</c></title>

                <p>Unicode uses multiple 8-bit bytes to represent characters, and these are typically expressed in hexadecimal (base 16) notation.  Using just a single byte, we can get 256 values, and the first 128 (hex <c>00</c> to <c>7F</c>) are the <q>usual</q> Latin characters with some values used as control codes.  These 95 characters are the most basic, and will all render using <c>pdflatex</c> or <c>xelatex</c> with no special setup (and will render easily in HTML).  <c>U+0000</c> to <c>U+001F</c> are control codes and not used here.  <c>U+007F</c> is also a control code and so is excluded, while <c>U+0020</c> is a space, so appears invisible in the table.  In the source we have authored each character by its escaped version using its Unicode number (in hexadecimal).  So, for example, capital-B is authored as <c>&amp;#x0042;</c>.</p>

                <p>Now we are interested in the next 128 possible bytes,  (hex <c>80</c> to <c>FF</c>).  The first 32 are again control codes and <c>U+00A0</c> is a non-breaking space, so is invisible, while <c>U+00AD</c> is a soft hyphen (which we have not implemented and so is excluded).  We have taken care to see that the remainder will render using <c>pdflatex</c> or <c>xelatex</c> with no special setup (and HTML).  In the source we have authored each character by its escaped version using its Unicode number (in hexadecimal).  So, for example, a copyright symbol is authored as <c>&amp;#x00A9;</c>.</p>

                <title>Monospace, Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement, <c>U+0000</c><ndash /><c>U+00FF</c></title>

                <p>A monospace font is critical for samples of keyboard input and to distinguish exact technical input from running commentary.  We list here all of the reasonable characters from the first 256 Unicode code points.  (We skip the same 65 control characters from above, and the soft hyphen.)  These should all render fine in HTML and when processed with <c>xelatex</c>, however our focus with this sample article for PDF output is the capabilities when processed with <c>pdflatex</c>.  First, characters from <c>U+0000</c><ndash /><c>U+007F</c>.</p>

                <p>Note that the single and double quotes are upright and dumb, not curly and smart: <c>' " ' " ' "</c>.  And a backtick is a backtick: <c>` ` `</c>.  The zero is distinguished from the capital <q>oh</q>: <c>0 O 0 O 0 O</c>.  And the numeral one is slightly different from the lower-case <q>ell</q>: <c>1 l 1 l 1 l</c>.  The hyphen should be short and not expanded into some other kind of dash: <c>- - -</c>.  These characters should all cut/paste out of a PDF into a text editor with no conversion to other characters.</p>

                <p>Now the remaining characters from <c>U+0080</c><ndash /><c>U+00FF</c>.  The <c>program</c> tag is implemented in <latex /> via the <c>listing</c> package and these characters require ad-hoc replacements for processing by <c>pdflatex</c>.  (You can see the replacements in the preamble of the <latex /> source for this document.)  The replacement mechanism provided by the <c>listing</c> package will cause the characters below to produce a <latex /> compilation error if processed by <c>pdflatex</c> and in a table cell in certain situations (which we have avoided in the table below).  The only workaround in this case is to switch to <c>xelatex</c>.</p>

            <p>Again, more examples and more thorough explanations can be found in the sample: <c>examples/fonts/fonts-and-characters.xml</c>.  Be aware that the nature of the more advanced sample is that it will likely produce many errors when processed with <c>pdflatex</c>.  Adding <c>-interaction batchmode</c> or <c>-interaction nonstopmode</c> to the <c>pdflatex</c> command-line will sometimes be less painless than acknowledging each error.

            <title>Pre-Formatted Text</title>

            <p>In Sage, if you wanted to build a matrix<idx>matrix</idx>, then you would use the <c>matrix()</c> constructor.  Here is the matrix of second partials of <m>f(x,y)=x^3+8x^2y^3 + y^4</m>, as you would enter it in Sage.  Notice that <c>SR</c> is the ring of symbolic expressions, <c>Symbolic Ring</c>.</p>

            <pre>
            var('x', 'y')
            J = matrix(SR, [
                [6*x + 16*y^3, 48*x*y^2],
                [48*x*y^2, 48*x^2*y + 12*y^2]
                ])
            </pre>

            <p>That accomplished, Sage will easily and naturally provide a <latex /> representation of the matrix with the command <c>latex(J)</c>.</p>

            <pre>
            \left(\begin{array}{rr}
            16 \, y^{3} + 6 \, x &amp; -48 \, x y^{2} \\
            48 \, x y^{2} &amp; 48 \, x^{2} y + 12 \, y^{2}
            \end{array}\right)
            </pre>

            <p>The <c>pre</c> element surrounds text that should be preserved verbatim.  It is like a special kind of paragraph, and can be used almost everywhere that a paragraph can be used.   The realization of preformatted text should be robust enough that it can be cut from documents and pasted without any substitutions of <q>fancier</q> Unicode characters for generic ASCII characters.  Try the <q>minus</q> sign on the <m>48</m> above to see if it does not become a dash, or the single quotes on the Sage variables.</p>

            <p>For Sage input code, the first non-whitespace character sets the left margin, since legitimate Python code has no subsequent lines outdented.  For pre-formatted code, the line with the <em>least</em> whitespace leading the line will determine the left margin.  If preserving indentation is important, do not mix spaces and tabs.  For syntax highlighting of text representing computer programs, or parts of them, see Section<nbsp /><xref ref="section-programs" />.  Examine the source of the following example to help understand this paragraph.</p>

            <pre>
            A normal line
                    An indented line
    An outdented line
            </pre>

            <p>Snippets should also be robust for cut/paste operations.  For example, you should not get <q>curly</q> <q>smart</q> quote marks in verbatim text: <c>this should have "dumb" quote marks</c>. Here are a few characters that should migrate through <latex /> to a PDF unmolested:  <c>'"----"'</c></p>

            <p><c>If you write a very long snippet of inline code (i.e. within a &lt;c&gt; element) it can impinge on the right margin, since very long words will not hypenate, unless you have a dash/hypen.  Such as when you use words like pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, parastratiosphecomyia stratiosphecomyioides, floccinaucinihilipilification, or subdermatoglyphic.  For output in LaTeX we get line-breaking, and perhaps word-spacing, but we do not get hyphenation and the font is fixed-width.  So not always perfect.  Consider other options like &lt;cd&gt; or &lt;pre&gt; below.</c></p>

            <p>An intermediate type of verbatim text can be accomplished with the <tag>cd</tag> tag, short for <q>code display.</q>  It allows for larger chunks of verbatim text to show up in the middle of a paragraph, but with some vertical space above and below, and centered between the margins.  It can be<cd>authored as a single line</cd>or if you wish to have multiple lines<cd>
                <cline>there is the &lt;cline&gt; tag</cline>
                <cline>meant to model the line tag</cline>
                <cline>and short for "code line"</cline>
            </cd>and you may even<cd>
                <cline>use a single cline</cline>
            </cd>if you like to have your source closely model the visual look of the output.</p>

            <p>The <tag>pre</tag> tag is meant for use outside of paragraphs, but is otherwise very similar.  The source may also be structured as a sequence of <tag>cline</tag> as in the next example, recycling content from above.</p>

            <pre>
                <cline>If you write a very long snippet of inline code (i.e. within</cline>
                <cline>a &lt;c&gt; element) it can impinge on the right margin, since</cline>

                <cline>pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis,</cline>
                <cline>parastratiosphecomyia stratiosphecomyioides,</cline>
                <cline>floccinaucinihilipilification, or subdermatoglyphic. For output</cline>

            <title>Program Listings</title>

            <p>Sage cells can be used for Python examples, but Sage uses a mild amount of pre-parsing, so that might not be a wise decision, especially in instructional settings.  We might implement Skulpt or Brython (in-browser Python) or the Python language argument to the Sage Cell Server.  To see examples of authoring Sage cells, have a look at Section<nbsp /><xref ref="section-sage-cells" />.</p>

            <p>In the meantime, program listings,<idx><h>listing</h></idx><idx><h>program listing</h></idx> especially with syntax highlighting, is useful all by itself.  The <q>R</q> language might not be a bad stand-in for pseudo-code, as it supports assignment with a left arrow and has fairly generic procedural syntax for control structures and data structures.  Or maybe Pascal would be a good choice?  Here is an example of R.  Note in the source that the entire block of code is wrapped in a CDATA section due to the four left angle brackets.  We do not recommend this technique for isolated problem characters, but it is a life-saver for situations like the <init>XSLT</init> code just following.</p>

Note that with no language specified, there is no special formatting or use of color.  Note in the source the use of escaped characters for the three less-than symbols.</p>

            <p>Look in the <c>mathbook-common.xsl</c> file to see the strings to use to identify languages.  Always all-lowercase, no symbols, no punctuation.</p>

            <p>Note that the above examples all have slightly different widths (theser are very evident in print with the frames).  As 2-D atomic objects, to place them in the narrative requires the layout features of a <c>sidebyside</c> element.  Then <c>width</c> and/or <c>margin</c> attributes will influence the width of the panel.</p>

            <p>A <c>program</c> may also be nested inside a <c>listing</c>, which behaves similar to a <c>figure</c>.  You can provide a <c>caption</c>, and the listing will be numbered along with tables and figures.  This then makes it possible to cross-reference the listing, such as <xref ref="listing-c-hello" text="type-global" />.  It also removes the requirement of wrapping the <c>program</c> in a <c>sidebyside</c>.  For technical reasons, the three examples above will not split across a page break in PDF output, but the placement inside a <c>listing</c> will allow splits, as you should see in at least one example following.</p>

            <listing xml:id="listing-c-hello">
                <caption>C Version of <q>Hello, World!</q></caption>

            <p>If you are discussing algorithms in the abstract (or even concretely), you can set them off like a theorem, with a number, a title and a target for cross-references.  Sometimes you claim an algorithm produces something in particular, or has certain properties, such as a theoretical run time, so a proof may be included.  See the discussion just preceding about (limited) options for pseudo-code.</p>

            <algorithm xml:id="algorithm-sieve-eratosthenes">
                <title>Sieve of Eratosthenes</title>

                    <p>On input of a positive integer <c>n</c> this algorithm will compute all the prime numbers up to, and including, <c>n</c>.

                <proof>
                    <p>Any element removed is a non-trivial product of two integers and hence composite.  So no prime is is ever removed from the list.</p>

                    <p>Each composite number is a multiple of some prime, and since no prime is ever removed, each composite will be removed.  Hence the removed elements are precisely the set of composite numbers in the list and thus the remainder are precisely the primes on the list.</p>
                </proof>
            </algorithm>

            <p>If you are writing about system-level software, you may need to write numbers in hexadecimal or binary.  Here we use a numbered, displayed equation (mathematics) and <latex /> macros such as <c>\texttt</c> for a monospace text font, and <c>\;</c> for spacing/grouping the bits of the binary number. <men>\texttt{6C2A}_{16} = \texttt{0110}\;\texttt{1100}\;\texttt{0010}\;\texttt{1010}_{2}</men>  If you use these constructions repeatedly, then some <latex /> macros might be useful.  It might also be beneficial for us to add some <pretext /> markup for such numbers used in a paragraph<mdash />send us a feature request.</p>

            <p>A specialized version of a program listing is an interactive command/response session at a command-line, where differing fonts are used to differentiate the system prompt, the user's commands, and the system's reaction.  A   <c>console</c> session may be used by itself inside a <c>sidebyside</c>, or it can be wrapped in a listing to get a number and a caption.  As elsewhere, you will need to escape ampersands and angle brackets (such as if you have a command using redirection), using <c>&amp;amp;</c>, <c>&amp;lt;</c>, and <c>&amp;gt;</c> in your source.</p>

            <title>Units of Measure</title>

            <p>Units of measure can be given xml treatment too with the <c>quantity</c> element. In <latex />, the <c>siunitx</c><idx><h>siunitx package</h></idx><idx><h>package</h><h>siunitx</h></idx><idx><h>units</h></idx> package is loaded to achive unit handling. Since that package only offers SI units, some other common units will be added by MBX in the preamble. In HTML, the capabilities of <c>siunitx</c> are simulated, weakly. Note that at present, you should not attempt to use the <c>quantity</c> element within a math environment.</p>
            <p>The value of gravitational constant <m>g</m> is <quantity><mag>9.8</mag><unit base="meter"/><per base="second" exp="2"/></quantity>. Force is measured in <quantity><unit prefix="kilo" base="gram"/><unit base="meter"/><per base="second" exp="2"/></quantity>, also known as one <quantity><unit base="newton"/></quantity>. A quantity with rather ridiculous units is <quantity><mag>23</mag><unit prefix='micro' base='hectare' exp='23'/><per base='degreeCelsius'/><per base='second' exp='2'/></quantity>. One <quantity><unit base="hertz"/></quantity> is the same as <quantity><per base='second'/></quantity>. You can have a unitless quantity, like <quantity><mag>42</mag></quantity>, which may help with consistency between such numbers and units in the <latex /> output. Some non-SI units are available, such as the absurd <quantity><unit base="degreeFahrenheit"/><unit base="foot"/><unit base="pound"/><per base="gallon"/></quantity>.  The <latex /> command <c>\pi</c> is recognized within <c>mag</c> in conversions to HTML, which is consistent with the behavior with a conversion to <latex />, for example there are
            <quantity>
                <mag>2\pi</mag>
                <unit base="radian"/>
            </quantity>
            in a full circle.</p>

            <p>For a full list of the allowed units and prefixes, see <c>mathbook-units.xsl</c>. If you have a need for more units, they need to be added to <c>mathbook-units.xsl</c> in the section that deals with units which are not part of <c>siunitx</c> by default.  Note that the <c>mag</c> element should come first, followed by the <c>unit</c> element, followed by the <c>per</c> element.</p>

            <title>Side-By-Side Panels</title>

            <introduction>
                <title>Introduction</title>

                <p>The flow of a page is almost universally top-to-bottom.  But at times you would like to go <em>across</em> a page, perhaps to compare items (identical content in two different languages), or to make good use of a page real estate by grouping several small items together (<eg /> images).  So the <tag>sidebyside</tag> tag is strictly a layout device, though it does convey some meaning by grouping certain objects together. A variety of different objects can be put side-by-side using the <c>sidebyside</c> element.  Specifically, <c>figure</c>, <c>image</c>, <c>tabular</c>, <c>p</c>, <c>ol</c>, <c>ul</c>, <c>dl</c>, <c>pre</c>, <c>poem</c>, and more.  The individual components of a <tag>sidebyside</tag> are generically called <term>panels</term><idx>panels</idx>.</p>

                <p>As a layout device, the <tag>sidebyside</tag> does not allow a <tag>caption</tag>, is never numbered, and therefore cannot be cross-referenced.  You may cross-reference whatever element holds the <tag>sidebyside</tag>, and many of the panels may be cross-referenced individually.</p>

                <p>As a first example, we have two single paragraphs, laid out with different widths, and slight margins on each side.  The widths have been chosen experimentally to get roughly identical heights for the two paragraphs of varying length.</p>

                <sidebyside widths="60% 31%" margins="3%">

            </introduction>

            <subsection>
                <title>Figures with Numbers Side-By-Side</title>

                <p>Figures, or other captioned items such as tables or listings, can be placed side-by-side using the <c>sidebyside</c> element.  The figures will be captioned and numbered as if they were part of the vertical flow of the document.  For example, see <xref ref="regular-figure" text="type-global"/> and <xref ref="another-regular-figure" text="type-global"/></p>

                <p>However, if the <tag>sidebyside</tag> is placed inside another <tag>figure</tag>, then the outer figure gets an overall caption and a <q>regular</q> number, while the captions of the interior items will be labelled as (a), (b), (c), etc; for example, see the subfigures in <xref ref="fig-sidebyside-global" text="type-global"/>. You can also cross-reference the subfigures individually, for example: <xref ref="fig-sidebyside-subfigure" text="type-global"/>.</p>

                <p>The <c>sidebyside</c> tag can have an attribute <c>widths</c> that specifies a percentage width of the page for each panel of the layout.  There are automatic margins by default, and any remaining width is divided evenly to space out the panels.  When the <c>margins</c> attribute is given as <c>auto</c>, or in the default case, the margins provided each equal half of the inter-panel space.</p>

                <p>With no attributes on the <c>sidebyside</c>, each panel is the same width and there is no inter-panel space and no margin.  For a <c>sidebyside</c> with a single panel, with its width specified, the panel will be centered.</p>

                <title>Images</title>

                <p>We can use the <c>sidebyside</c> element to put <c>images</c><idx>image</idx> next to each other.  These will illustrate a text, but with no captions or numbers, cannot be cross-referenced.  This next example has <c>10%</c> margins, and the panels have widths <c>25%</c> and <c>40%</c>, leaving <c>15%</c> computed as the one inter-panel space.</p>

                <sidebyside widths="25% 40%" margins="10%">
                    <image source="images/cross-square.png"/>
                    <image source="images/cross-square.png"/>
                </sidebyside>

                <p>Now we fine-tune with different widths (which add up to 100%).  The five imgages have been given different vertical alignments, <c>top middle bottom top middle</c> via the <c>valigns</c> attribute.</p>

                <sidebyside widths="10% 30% 20% 20% 20%" margins="0%" valigns="top middle bottom top middle">
                    <image source="images/cross-square.png"/>
                    <image source="images/cross-square.png"/>

                    <image source="images/cross-square.png"/>
                </sidebyside>

                <p>If you want an overall caption to a group of images, but no sub-captions on your images, that is also straightforward.  This example has no attributes specified.  The overall <tag>figure</tag> may be cross-referenced, as <xref ref="figure-double-image" text="type-global" /></p>

                <title>Common Side-By-Side Constructions</title>

                <p>We have now seen at least one example of each of the four most common constructions involving <c>sidebyside</c>.  Working from the exterior inward, we can go <c>figure</c>, <c>sidebyside</c>, <c>figure</c>, <c>X</c>, where <c>X</c> is some atomic (unnumbered) item we might use elsewhere in a <pretext /> document, the inner <c>figure</c> may be repeated with different objects <c>X</c>, and the <c>figure</c>s have captions.  Each <c>figure</c> is independently optional, leading to the four combinations in this table.  Note this applies to any captioned item used inside the <c>sidebyside</c>, but a <c>figure</c> is the most flexible.</p>

                <title>A Single Captionless Image</title>

                <p>Sometimes you may want to include a single <c>image</c> or <c>table</c> in an example or exercise without a caption.   This formerly required a <c>sidebyside</c>, but here we are testing a more direct markup. The first has width <c>10%</c>, and the second has width <c>10%</c> and left margin of <c>25%</c>.</p>

                <image source="images/cross-square.png" width="10%"/>

                <p>A paragraph, just to show where the first stops and the second ends.</p>

                <image source="images/cross-square.png" width="10%" margins="25% 65%"/>

                <p>You might wish to place a single image flush-left, or flush-right.  You can specify the <c>margins</c> attribute as a pair of percentages for different left and right margins.  The following are laid out with two margins, with a 0% left margin and right margin (respectively). </p>

                <sidebyside width="10%" margins="0% 90%">
                    <image source="images/cross-square.png"/>
                </sidebyside>

                <sidebyside width="10%" margins="90% 0%">
                    <image source="images/cross-square.png"/>
                </sidebyside>

                <p>Results will be incorrect for the latter if the widths of the left margin and the panel do not add to 100%.  In general, in the case of a single panel, the left margin, right margin, and panel width should all add up to 100%.</p>

                <p>Of course, asymmetric margins may be used with several panels.  The following is designed to leave a 25% gap between the two panels.</p>

                <sidebyside width="10%" margins="45% 10%">
                    <image source="images/cross-square.png"/>

                <p>Most of our demonstrations here use our square <q>blue cross</q> test image, which is provided as a <init>PNG</init> image.  You may specify images by any of the methods described in the section on graphics, <xref ref="graphics" text="type-global" />.  The complete graph below is specified with no file extension, on the assumption that an <init>SVG</init> version exists for <init>HTML</init> output, and a <init>PDF</init> version exists for <latex /> output.  The second is a <init>JPEG</init> image that we use elsewhere for a YouTube video, but recycle here as an image provided in that format.  By default, they are aligned at their tops.</p>

                <p>Here are two TikZ images, authored side-by-side.  The first has had its geometric portions of the original scaled down to 75%, with the effect of increasing the text, relatively, so the application in a side-by-side panel with 25% width has legible text.  We caption only the second panel, which has no text adjustments.  From <url href="http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/">TeXample.net</url>.</p>

                <p>A <q>regular</q> list normally belongs in a <c>p</c> but it can be placed unadorned into a panel of a side-by-side, as demonstrated below in <xref ref="subsection-sbs-other-panels" text="type-global" />.  You can also put <q>named</q> lists into a panel, and then the title, introduction, conclusion, and caption will behave as expected, along with a number that might be used in a cross-reference (<xref ref="color-list-as-panel" text="global" />), or perhaps we might cross-reference by title, <xref ref="color-list-as-panel" text="title" />.</p>

                <title>Stacking: Back to Vertical Flow</title>

                <p>You might wish to mix disparate items within a panel, returning to a vertical flow within a panel.  For example, you might want a diagram to the left and some paragraphs of commentary to the right.  Or perhaps a photograph on one side and a list of bullet points to the other side.  A <tag>stack</tag> is a container that can only be used to collect several items into a single panel of a <tag>sidebyside</tag>.  You cannot point to it, but you can point to its contents as usual.  Contents may be anything you could otherwise put into a <c>sidebyside</c> panel that does not have a <tag>caption</tag> or a <tag>title</tag>.  In particular, these panels cannot be sub-numbered since the panel cannot be made into a <tag>figure</tag>.</p>

                <p>Similar items can also be stacked, of course.  Most importantly, a normal panel will accept a single paragraph.  If you want several paragraphs, simply collect them in a <c>stack</c>.</p>

                <sidebyside widths="55% 35%" valigns="middle top">
                    <stack>
                        <p>A simple sentence inside a single <tag>p</tag> as the first item in a stack.</p>
                        <image source="images/cross-rectangle.png" />
                    </stack>
                    <stack>
                        <image source="images/cross-rectangle.png" />
                        <p>A less simple sentence that will wrap inside the panel to make the right panel taller and allow us to experiment with sliding the left panel contents up and down, here it is placed in the <c>middle</c>.</p>
                    </stack>
                </sidebyside>

                <p>We have an image to the left, as a regular panel (not a stack).  In the right panel we stack a list of properties, followed by a descriptive paragraph.  We middle-align the stack at the <c>bottom</c>, just as a demonstration (it would likely look better with <c>top</c> alignment).</p>

                <p>We imagine a <tag>sidebyside</tag> using a <tag>stack</tag> to enable constructions like a table of data in one panel, and maybe a plot with some text next to it.</p>

                <p>In the toy example next, the list of data is rigid, so we have set the first panel width to <c>40%</c>, a value obtained experimentally to just contain the list.  This allow us to set the second panel to a width of <c>58%</c>, and we use no margins.  If you try to balance the heights of the two panels, this can become a bit of a zero-sum game.  A wider second column means the text occupies fewer lines, but the wider image also creates a taller image, consuming more vertical space.</p>

                    <p>Remember that <tag>sidebyside</tag> has attributes that strongly influence layout.  That is intentional.  But to support a variety of output formats, it does not allow overly-precise control, and they be viewed as providing <em>hints</em> to an implementer of a conversion.  So for example, do not expect <tag>sidebyside</tag> to function like a <latex /> <c>tabular</c> or an <init>HTML</init> <c>table</c>.</p>

                    <p>In particular, elements of two consecutive <tag>stack</tag> will not line up, unless perhaps you construct them identically.  Consider a <tag>sbsgroup</tag> for something closer to putting items into rows.</p>

                <p>Pre-formatted text may be included by using the <c>pre</c> element.  This content is horizontally-rigid, so as the author, you need to be sure to provide enough width for the panel to contain the content.  It is easy to see the boundary of the panels when rendered in HTML since there is a background that fills the panel.</p>

                <p>Poems are not horizontally-rigid, but they are not perfectly horizontally-flexible either.  The left copy of this next poem is in a panel roughly 2/3 the width of the page and fits there.  The right copy has the first five lines and is in space about half the previous width, and you can see the lines being wrapped with obvious indentation.  So you <em>can</em> constrain the width of a poem if you do not mind the additional indentation.  (Recognize that this example is a bit extreme.)</p>

                <title>Side-By-Side Groups</title>

                <p>A <q>side-by-side group,</q> <tag>sbsgroup</tag>, is still in development.  (Notably, subcaptions do not behave as expected.)  It is a sequence of <c>sidebyside</c>, which may conceivably use the same margins, widths and vertical alignments for each horizontal run of panels.  Attributes on the <c>sbsgroup</c> are global to the group's enclosed <c>sidebyside</c>, and will be used by each contained <c>sidebyside</c>.  If attributes are present on an individual <c>sidebyside</c>, they override the global values.  The next two examples demonstrate some of this behavior, in a limited way.</p>

                <p>A long poem, when placed into a <c>sidebyside</c> will not fit onto a physical page and will not break across pages.  With a <c>sbsgroup</c> you can put each stanza (say) into its own <c>sidebyside</c> and place something (commentary) next to it.  We include the <c>title</c> with the first stanza and the <c>author</c> with the last stanza.  This device can also be useful to attach commentary to specific stanzas.</p>

                <p>The main rationale for <c>sbsgroup</c> is to layout a grid of items, and by placing the layout parameters on the <c>sbsgroup</c> element, the items can line up across <c>sidebyside</c> and subcaptioning can run across the whole group.  So, for example, if you have images to compare by placing in a grid, then making them all the same size, or of the same aspect ratio, can help with the overall consistency.</p>

                <p>This example has three <c>sidebyside</c>, each with four <c>figure</c> containing an identical <c>image</c>.  Since the images are identical and the <c>width</c> is set to 20% they should all line up nicely with little effort.  Since the default for margins is automatic, the remaining 20% of the overall width will be used for three inter-panel spaces of 5% and two margins of 2.5% each.  Note the numbering of these as independent figures.  We have left the captions empty for reasons of space, but you could add more information.  Note that in print, a page break is allowed between any two of the <c>sidebyside</c> and cannot be suppressed.</p>

                <p>This subsection has non-side-by-side structures, to aid with the effects of styling decisions across the range of possibilities.  First a <c>figure</c> with a <c>caption</c> holding a scaled image and a cross-reference for knowl testing: <xref ref="figure-traditional" text="type-global" />.</p>

        <section>
            <title>Side-by-Side Gallery</title>

            <p>This subsection attempts to survey all the possible items that can be placed into a <c>sidebyside</c> element, in various combinations.  While intended to be exhaustive across contents, it does not test all possibilities, and is not meant to be instructive (see <xref ref="section-side-by-side" text="type-global" /> for that). The layout is identical for each <c>sidebyside</c>, 5% margins, panel widths of 40% and 45%, leaving 5% for the space between the panels.  The vertical alignment is left at the default, <c>top</c>.</p>

            <p>We begin with <q>simpler</q> atomic items.  If necessary, comments follow each.</p>

            <p>Be aware that the lines of <c>pre</c> can spill outside of its panel without any word-wrapping.  So you may need to vary panel widths or rearrange line breaks manually.  Page width is a scarce resource.</p>

            <p>Images will scale to fill their panel's width.  We provide no services to change the aspect ratio of your images, that is your responsibility to accomplish elsewhere.  This rectangular image will have slightly different widths, and so will be slightly deeper in the right panel (at a 45:40 ratio).  Remember, vertical alignment is at the top.</p>

            <p>Now we turn to <q>captioned</q> items: <c>figure</c>, <c>table</c>, <c>listing</c>, and the anomalous <q>named list</q>, <c>list</c>, whose future is uncertain.  We test subcaptions here.  Note that many different atomic items can go in a figure, and largely they will behave in a <c>sidebyside</c> much as they do when placed in a panel all by themselves (<ie /> captionless).</p>

            <p>Videos can be placed quite compactly for HTML output, but we display a fair amount of information for a YouTube video in print, and therefore two videos side-by-side gets pretty crowded.  The examples above have the bare minimum amount of information attached (not in an overarching <c>figure</c>), and the bare amount which which is displayed in print.  We could relax our common spacing to make it a bit better.  For other examples see <xref ref="section-video" text="type-global" />.</p>

            <p>We make an exception to our common layout and put one YouTube video, with a start and end time into a single panel of a <c>sidebyside</c> as a <c>figure</c> with a <c>title</c> and a <c>caption</c> that is rendered as a sub-caption.  Read about <q>side-by-side</q> groups (<c>sbsgroup</c>) and experiment with stacking several sub-captioned videos into an overall captioned figure (<xref ref="subsection-sbsgroup" text="type-global" />).</p>

            <p>There is support for poems via the <c>poem</c><idx>poem</idx> tag, which can contain a <c>title</c>, <c>author</c> and multiple <c>stanza</c>, each containing multiple <c>line</c>.  See the source of the following poem for an example of the exact arrangement.  Note how the first quote crosses two <c>line</c> elements and how this is handled in the source.

            <introduction>
                <p>This section demonstrates the numbering<idx>numbering</idx> patterns used throughout <pretext />.  There are five subsections.  Two intermediate subsections each have two subsubsections.  This creates a total of seven divisions that are leaves of the document tree.  In each leaf we have placed two numbered theorems, for a total of fourteen.  There is no real content, this is just a demonstration.</p>

                <p>Use values of <c>0</c> through <c>3</c> for the <c>numbering.theorems.level</c> parameter to see how these numbers change accordingly.  It is easiest to compare if you use <c>chunk.level &lt; 2</c> so the theorems all land on the same page if you are previewing in HTML.</p>

                    <p>Conclusion now.  We include two theorems as numbered items in the conclusion to test their numbers, which are sometimes totally illogical and are inconsistent across output formats.  To see the effect, use <c>--stringparam numbering.theorems.level 3</c> in the <c>xsltproc</c> invocation.

            <p>Once your content is in place, you can begin thinking about various useful derivative works.  A natural example for a textbook is an <q>Instructor's Version</q>.  Various switches for hints, answers, and solutions to exercises would allow you to include more of these for the use of just an instructor.  Here we also demonstrate the <tag>commentary</tag> element.  It is similar in many ways to a <tag>paragraphs</tag> in that it can be placed within any division and must be titled.  The main difference is that it is not displayed by default, so you must set a processing switch to enable its appearance:<cd>
                <cline>xsltproc -stringparam commentary yes ...</cline>
            </cd>Other distinctions are:<ul>
                <li>Since it is elective, you need to be careful about cross-references to and from a <tag>commentary</tag>.  It is highly likely that you will want to make cross-references <em>within</em> a <tag>commentary</tag> <em>pointing to</em> other portions of your text, and this is always a good idea.  You will want to avoid making cross-references <em>to</em> a <tag>commentary</tag> from other parts of the text, with the exception of a cross-reference that originates <em>within</em> some <tag>commentary</tag>.</li>
                <li>Numbered items are prohibited within a <tag>commentary</tag>, such as a <tag>figure</tag> or a <tag>theorem</tag>.  Doing so would disrupt consecutive numbering in different versions, with or without, <tag>commentary</tag> included.  Numbered equations are not prohibited in the schema, but should definitely be avoided anyway.</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>After some nonsense text in a paragraph, there is a <tag>commentary</tag> with two paragraphs.  For the online version of this sample article, we have enabled commentaries.  But if you are experimenting yourself, you will want to be aware if you are enabling these or not.</p>

            <title>Exercises, One Subsection</title>

            <p>This <tag>section</tag> of the sample article demonstrates an <q>unstructured division.</q>  There are no <tag>subsection</tag>, you are just reading the first two paragraphs, followed by some nonsense text.  Then there is a <em>single</em> <tag>exercises</tag> division.  Note that this division is not numbered (since it is unique within the <tag>section</tag>).  And a cross-reference to one of the contained <tag>exercise</tag> will be numbered as a member of the <tag>section</tag>, <xref ref="exercise-challenging-one-unstructured" text="type-global" />.</p>

            <p>If you use the unstructured form of a division, <em>and</em> have both inline and divisional exercises, there is a potential to form ambiguous cross-references.  To wit, check that <xref ref="duplicate-inline" text="global" /> and <xref ref="duplicate-divisional" text="global" /> are really different exercises (which you are <em>unable to do</em> if you are reading this in print!).  The solution is to include the type of exercise in the reference, which will assist everybody, but especially your print readers:  <xref ref="duplicate-inline" text="type-global" /> and <xref ref="duplicate-divisional" text="type-global" />.</p>

            <p>Compare this section with the similar <xref ref="exercises-multiple" text="type-global" />, next.  The following text is mostly nonsense, just for testing purposes.</p>

                <solution>
                    <p>Maybe a global switch should be used to suppress solutions, while a separate processing regime could use them as part of a solutions manual.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes you may want the solutions to exercises within a single <tag>exercises</tag> division (or similar, like a <tag>worksheet</tag>).  Default behavior in this situation can produce two titles, when just one would be sufficient.

                <title>List of Results</title>

                <p>We had an automatic list of theorems for just one section, back in <xref ref="subsection-local-theorems" text="type-global" />.  Here we expand to include <c>corollary</c> in our space-delimited list of <c>elements</c> and we request <c>divisions</c> (headings) at each <c>subsection</c> and <c>section</c>.  The default <c>scope</c> is the entire document, which is appropriate here in the backmatter.  There are many subsections with no results, so we set the <c>empty</c> attribute to <c>no</c> to suppress them, though this is the default behavior (<c>yes</c> being the other option to see divisions with no list items).  These lists are most valuable if you are in the practice of giving items titles.</p>

                <title>Index</title>

                <p>There is an index manufactured at the end of the back matter.  So we are talking about it here, rather than within the index, which is an impossibility.  It contains some sample entries, and is not meant to be comprehensive.  Look at the source of this XML file, searching on <tag>idx</tag>, to see how they are written.  They may be placed inside of a a variety of structures, and their location greatly influences the cross-references produced in the HTML version of the index.</p>

                <p>The <latex /> version of the index is more traditional, using page numbers to reference locations.  A newer package is used to create the index, and so there is no extra intermediate step required to process the index.  The one downside of this convenience is that index entries may not be placed in the back colophon (which is the only subdivision that may follow the index).</p>

                <p>There is an index entry about multicolumn lists which spans more than one page.  This requires doubly-linked index entries, the first has the index content and points to the <c>xml:id</c> of the second.  The second is an empty element, but points back to the <c>xml:id</c> of the first entry.  So each has a marker and a reference, which allows the span of the index topic to cut across XML boundaries in the source.  This is the mechanism to produce a page range in the <latex /> index.  See the source of this article for syntax details.</p>

                <paragraphs>
                    <title>Bully Pulpit: Index Headings</title>

                    <p>Professionals do not capitalize the headings (entries) of an index, unless it is a proper noun (name, place, <etc />).  We do not provide any enforcement of this advice, nor any assistance.  It is your responsibility to provide quality source material in this regard.</p>
