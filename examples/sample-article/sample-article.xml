                <introduction>
                    <p>This is an introduction, where you might explain that this division of the back matter contains various hints, answers, solutions of inline exercises, divisional exercises, project-like blocks, worksheet exercises, and/or reading questions.  See the source to see just how this solutions division was built.</p>

                <conclusion>
                    <p>And a conclusion to this solutions division, which may not be readily apparent as distinct from the final division's worth of solutions, but since it is not prefixed with a number, it may be different enough.</p>

                <introduction>
                    <p>The back matter solutions appendix requests every <tag>answer</tag>, and only <tag>answer</tag>, of all types of exercises: inline, divisional, worksheet, reading questions, and projects.  Now, as observed by Bruce Yoshiwara, it gets a bit tedious to see the <q>Answer</q> heading over and over in print, when every entry has that heading.  So we squelch it for you in print/PDF output.  (For <init>HTML</init> output we use knowls and need to have something to click on.  But perhaps for <init>EPUB</init> we should be more careful?)  Note that you might want to use a <tag>title</tag>, or an <tag>introduction</tag>, that explains which component of the exercises is being displayed, so there is no confusion.</p>

                <title>List of Results</title>

                <p>We had an automatic list of theorems for just one section, back in .  Here we expand to include <c>corollary</c> in our space-delimited list of <c>elements</c> and we request <c>divisions</c> (headings) at each <c>subsection</c> and <c>section</c>.  The default <c>scope</c> is the entire document, which is appropriate here in the backmatter.  There are many subsections with no results, so we set the <c>empty</c> attribute to <c>no</c> to suppress them, though this is the default behavior (<c>yes</c> being the other option to see divisions with no list items).  These lists are most valuable if you are in the practice of giving items titles.</p>

                <p>Since <tag>exercise</tag> come in several flavors, we use <term>pseudo-elements</term> to specify the distinct types.  There are not many reading questions<mdash/>but here is a list of all of them, by section, using a <c>readingquestion</c> pseudo-element.</p>

                <list-of elements="readingquestion" divisions="section" empty="no"/>

                <p>And now a list of all the inline exercises, and including the title of every <tag>section</tag>, even if there is no inline exercise contained inside it.  The pseudo-element is <c>inlineexercise</c>.</p>

            <appendix label="appendix-index">
                <title>Index</title>

                <p>There is an index manufactured at the end of the back matter.  So we are talking about it here, rather than within the index, which is an impossibility.  It contains some sample entries, and is not meant to be comprehensive.  Look at the source of this XML file, searching on <tag>idx</tag>, to see how they are written.  They may be placed inside of a a variety of structures, and their location greatly influences the cross-references produced in the HTML version of the index.</p>

                <p>The <latex/> version of the index is more traditional, using page numbers to reference locations.  A newer package is used to create the index, and so there is no extra intermediate step required to process the index.  The one downside of this convenience is that index entries may not be placed in the back colophon (which is the only subdivision that may follow the index).</p>

                <p>There is an index entry about multicolumn lists which spans more than one page.  This requires doubly-linked index entries, the first has the index content and points to the <c>xml:id</c> of the second.  The second is an empty element, but points back to the <c>xml:id</c> of the first entry.  So each has a marker and a reference, which allows the span of the index topic to cut across XML boundaries in the source.  This is the mechanism to produce a page range in the <latex/> index.  See the source of this article for syntax details.</p>

                <paragraphs>
                    <title>Bully Pulpit: Index Headings</title>

                    <p>Professionals do not capitalize the headings (entries) of an index, unless it is a proper noun (name, place, <etc/>).  We do not provide any enforcement of this advice, nor any assistance.  It is your responsibility to provide quality source material in this regard.</p>

                    <p>You might want to have lists of references, in the back, but with multiple such lists.  Make an <tag>appendix</tag> to hold them, give it some structure (for an <tag>article</tag>, a leading <tag>subsection</tag>, such as the one you are reading right now), then follow with multiple <tag>references</tag> divisions.  A typical citation will then look like: <xref ref="biblio-strang-article-tres"/>.</p>
