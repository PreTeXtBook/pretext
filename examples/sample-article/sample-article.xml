            <p>You can give a Sage element a <c>doctest</c><idx>doctest</idx><idx><h>attributes</h><h>doctest</h></idx> attribute, whose value mirrors the optional hash tags used in Sage doctests.  Possible values are <c>random</c>, <c>long time</c>, <c>not implemented</c>, <c>not tested</c>, <c>known bug</c>, <c>absolute</c>, <c>relative</c>, and <c>optional</c>.  The values <c>absolute</c> and <c>relative</c> refer to floating-point tolerances for equality and require a second attribute <c>tolerance</c> to specify a floating point value.  The value <c>optional</c> refers to the test requiring that an optional Sage package be present.  The name of that package should be provided in the <c>package</c> attribute.</p>

            <!-- The four index entries below once sorted/consolidated very poorly -->
            <p>The next cell is marked in the source as <c>doctest="random"</c>, and so is specified as unpredictable and not tested.  But there is some <q>sample</q> output which will appear in the <latex /> version (and always be the same).

            <p>While the next cell is random, the returned value will never be more than <m>0.01</m> away from <m>12</m>, since the <c>random()</c> function stays between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>.  So we provide <m>12.005</m> as the expected answer, but test with an absolute tolerance of <m>\epsilon=0.006</m>.</p>

            <p>Sage has some functions which affect output, generally making mathematics look more like mathematics via <latex/> syntax.  This is a simple test, and you should see the variable and superscript in italics, properly formatted as output when viewed within HTML output.  We have provided expected output for doctesting, but it is sort of silly to have this as part of <latex/> output, even if it is instructive.</p>

            <!-- keep R index entry, collides with sortby attribute elsewhere -->
            <p>Sage, and by extension, the Sage Cell Server, can interpret several languages.  The next example has code in the <c>R</c> language,<idx><h>R</h></idx> a popular open source language for statistics.  As an author, you add the attribute <c>language="r"</c> to your <c>sage</c> element.  (The default language is Sage, so you do not need to indicate that repeatedly.)  Note that a language like <c>R</c> likes to use a <q>less than</q> character, &lt;, special character in XML.  You need to escape it by writing <c>&amp;lt;</c> as we have done in the source for this example.  (See the discussion in <xref ref="subsection-xml-escape" text="type-global"/>.)</p>

            <p>As a reader you learn that the <q>Evaluate</q> button for a pre-loaded Sage cell will indicate the language in use.</p>

            <sage doctest="not tested" language="r">

            <p>The Sage Cell Server supports the following languages:  <c>sage</c>, <c>gap</c>, <c>gp</c>, <c>html</c>, <c>maxima</c>, <c>octave</c>, <c>python</c>, <c>r</c>, and <c>singular</c>.</p>

            <p>Here is another <c>R</c> cell.  Unfortunately, it seems Sage's <c>doctest</c> facility cannot be used easily with code from other languages.  In the source for this example, we have employed the <init>XML</init> escape sequence, <c>&amp;lt;</c> several times (see <xref ref="subsection-xml-escape" text="type-global"/>).</p>

            <p>Here is a blank Sage cell that you may use for practice and experimentation with the commands above.  Note that this cell allows a choice of languages, and is not linked with any of the previous cells, so a reader would need to start fresh, or cut/paste definitions from other cells.</p>

            <sage type="practice" />

            <p>On the other hand a <tag>sage</tag> element with no content will also create an empty Sage cell for the reader's use, but now it will be specific to a particular language and linked to others of the same language.  Run the <c>R</c> cell above that defines the variable <c>ruth</c> and then try typing <c>summary(ruth)</c> in the cell below.</p>

            <sage language="r" />

            <p>You can make Sage blocks which are of <c>type="invisible"</c>, which will never be shown to a reader, but which get doctested.  Why do this?  If some code produces an error, and you hope it is fixed someday, use an invisible block to raise the error.  Once fixed, the doctest will fail, and you can adjust your commentary to suit.  There is such a block right now, <em>but</em> you will need to go to the source to see it.</p>

            <p>Our maximum width for text, designed for readability, suggests you should format your Sage code with a maximum of about 54 characters. On a mobile device, the number of displayed characters might be as low as 28 in portrait orientation, and again around 50 in landscape.  You can use a variety of techniques to shorten long lines, such as using intermediate variables.  Since Sage is just a huge Python library, you can use any of Python's facilities for handling long lines.  These include a continuation character (which I try to avoid using) or natural places where you can break long lines, such as between entries of a list.  Also, if writing loops or functions, you may wish to have your indentation be only two characters wide (rather than, say, four).</p>

            <p>Sage output can sometimes be quite long, though this has improved with some changes in Sage's output routines.  Output code should be included primarily for doctesting purposes, and in this use, you may break at almost whitespace character and the doctesting framework will adjust accordingly.  You may wish to show sample output in a static format, like a PDF, so you can consider formatting your output to fit the width constraints of that medium.  Or you may even adjust exactly what is output, to keep it from being too verbose.  Sage doctesting also allows for a wild-card style syntax which allows you to skip over huge chunks of meaningless or unpredictable output, such as tracebacks on error messages.</p>

        <!--
        Next section illustrates more involved presentation of
        mathematics.  The "mdn" element is shorthand for
        "mathematics display, numbered".  There is a "men"
        element for "math equation, numbered" and a "md" for
        "math display" (with no numbers).  Numbering may be
        selectively suppressed or enabled, per line (shown
        here once).  An "xml:id" alias may be used on any
        numbered line.

        Multi-line displays ("md", "mdn") require that lines
        be delimited as "math rows" with the "mrow" element.
        These displays are implemented with the AMSMath align
        environment, which uses ampersands (&) for formatting
        control.  This is an evil situation, but the (easy) way
        around it is to use "&amp;" in this situation.

        The previous sections were sequences of paragraphs, along with
        theorems, Sage code, etc.  The next section has subsections, so
        the structure must look like *only* subsections, excepting a
        brief introduction and conclusion (that are sequences of

That's it.</p>

                    <p>For testing purposes, there is a simple Sage Cell here, buried inside an example that should be a knowl (embedded in the page).</p>

                <p>There are some Sage cells in the previous (knowled) <tag>example</tag>.  The results there are restricted to the knowl.  In other words, the scope of those cells is the knowl.  So if you opened the example and executed the Sage cells there, or if you skipped the example entirely, the next cell should not <q>know</q> the values of those variables and will raise an error.</p>

                    <p>Using an <q>integral sign</q> for an antiderivative (aka indefinite integral) would seem to make the Fundamental Theorem a <foreign xml:lang="fr-FR">fait accompli</foreign>.  So I would suggest not conflating the notation for two very different things until the Fundamental Theorem exposes them as being highly related.</p>

                        <p>A set of reading questions may have an <tag>introduction</tag>, perhaps for preparatory explanation.</p>
                        <p>If a student has logged in to the HTML version,
                           then they can answer the reading questions directly in the book.
                           Inline math LaTeX can be entered using
                           <c>$</c>...<c>$</c> or <c>\(</c>...<c>\)</c> delimiters,
                           and inline AsciiMath using backticks <c>`</c>...<c>`</c> as delimiters.
                           Here are some `gratuitous backticks` to check that AsciiMath is only
                           active in the answers to reading questions.
                        </p>
                    </introduction>

                    <exercise xml:id="first-reading">
                      <p>
                        This is a <term>reading question</term> that you might have a student answer prior to a class session,
                        based on reading part of the book.
                        A quick glance before class can help you tailor class time to the specific needs of your students.
                        The perfect reading question will reveal whether the student has read and understood the material,
                        and will be difficult to answer if they have not.
                        What do you think of that?

                        And a second one, with a cross-reference to the first,

                        Reading questions are allowed to have answers,
                        but providing answers misses the point of a reading question,
                        and the answer knowl interacts poorly with the mechanism used to
                        allow students to answer directly in the book.
                        Do you think the schema should ban answers to reading questions?

            <subsection>
                <title>Theorem-Like Environments</title>

                <p>There are a variety of pre-defined environments in <pretext />.  All take a title, and must have a statement.  Some have proofs (theorems, corollaries, <etc />), while some do not have proofs (conjectures, axioms, principles).</p>

                <principle xml:id="principle-principle">
                    <title>The Title Principle</title>

                    <statement>
                        <p>It is a fundamental principle that many elements can have a title.  Try it and see. If you get better formatting, then it is being recognized.  If it looks very plain, check the documentation and perhaps make a feature request.</p>
                    </statement>
                </principle>

                <p>More precisely, <tag>theorem</tag>, <tag>corollary</tag>, <tag>lemma</tag>, <tag>algorithm</tag>, <tag>proposition</tag>, <tag>claim</tag>, <tag>fact</tag>, and <tag>identity</tag>, all behave exactly the same, requiring a statement (as a sequence of paragraphs) followed by an optional proof, and may have an optional title.  The elements <tag>axiom</tag>, <tag>conjecture</tag>, <tag>principle</tag>, <tag>heuristic</tag>, <tag>hypothesis</tag>, and <tag>assumption</tag> are functionally the same, barring a proof (since they would never have one!).  Definitions are an exception, as it is natural to place <tag>notation</tag> within<mdash />see the source for Definition<nbsp /><xref ref="definition-indefinite-integral" /> for an example.</p>

            <subsection>
                <title>Linking Sage Cells</title>
                <idx><h>Sage cells</h><h>linking</h></idx>

                <p>Sage cells share their results on a per-webpage basis, or a per-knowl basis, so if you move to a new chapter, section, or subsection that happens to be on another webpage, your Sage computations are gone and you start fresh.  But maybe you need some results from elsewhere.  As an author, you can make an exact copy of a cell in another location by placing the code in an external file, which is pure text, freed from any need to format for XML processing.  So, in particular, there is no need to escape ampersands and angle brackets, nor is there employment of the <c>CDATA</c> mechanism.  But the real value is that there is just one version to edit, and any changes will be reflected in both copies.  We demonstrate this in the sample book, since it has the <c>xinclude</c> mechanism in place.  In the chapter on groups, find the section on Sage and then find the discussion of subgroups, and you will find an example of two identical Sage cells produced from one source file.</p>

                    <p>An <tag>assemblage</tag> is a collection, or summary, that does not have much structure to it.  So you are limited to paragraphs and friends (<c>p</c>, <c>blockquote</c>, <c>pre</c>) and side-by-sides that do not contain captioned items (<c>sidebyside</c>, <c>sbsgroup</c>).  The intent is that contents are not numbered, so cannot be cross-referenced individually, and so also do not become knowls.  You may place <tag>image</tag>, <tag>tabular</tag>, and <tag>program</tag> inside a <tag>sidebyside</tag>, in addition to other objects that do not have captions.  Note that <c>p</c> may by extension contain lists (<c>ol</c>, <c>ul</c>, <c>dl</c>).  Despite limited structure, the presentation should draw attention to it, because the contents should be seen as more important in some way.  It should be <q>highlighted</q> in some manner.  If you need to connect the entire assemblage with material elsewhere, you can do that with the usual <c>xref/xml:id</c> mechanism.<idx><h>assemblage</h></idx></p>

                    <p>An introduction or conclusion is an extremely restrictive container with simple presentation.  A title is optional (and probably not advisable).  Content is meant to be short and unstructured, in particular, nothing that can be numbered is allowed.  If this feels <em>too</em> restrictive, then place your content in an initial numbered subdivision and perhaps title it <q>Introduction</q>.  Or make your entire subdivion unstructured and place whatever you want into it.</p>

                    <p>Entirely analogous to introductions are conclusions.  Any subdivision may have a sequence of paragraphs within a <tag>conclusion</tag> that follows previous further subdivisions.  You are reading one now.  They are always leaves of the document structure, so are rendered on some pages that reference the preceding subdivisions.</p>

                   <p>This concludes this conclusion (and this subsection and this section).</p>
                </conclusion>
            </subsection>

            <subsection xml:id="subsection-paragraph-markup">
                <title>Some Paragraph-Level Markup</title>

                <p>Text within a paragraph may be <em>emphasized</em><idx><h>em</h><h>emphasis</h></idx><idx><h>styling words</h><h>em</h></idx><idx><h>styling words</h><h>emphasis</h></idx> with <tag>em</tag> or if you want to take it to the next level you can identify the text as an <alert>alert</alert><idx>alert</idx><idx><h>styling words</h><h>alert</h></idx> with <tag>alert</tag>.</p>

                <p>Similarly, within a paragraph, you can identify edits between versions as <insert>inserted text that has been added</insert><idx><h>styling words</h><h>insert</h></idx> with <tag>insert</tag> or as <delete>deleted text that has been removed</delete><idx><h>styling words</h><h>delete</h></idx> with <tag>delete</tag>.  Note that these identified edits are slightly different than <stale>stale text that you want to retain, but which is no longer relevant</stale><idx><h>styling words</h><h>stale</h></idx>, which is accomplished with <tag>stale</tag>.  The original request for stale text came from an instructor with an online list of student topics for presentations, and as students claimed topics they were marked as no longer available for other students.</p>

                <p>If you need a <q>fill-in blank</q>, like this <fillin />, it can be obtained with an empty <tag>fillin</tag> element that defaults to roughly a 10-character width.  You can use the <attr>characters</attr> attribute to make the rule longer or shorter, such as a 40-character blank: <fillin characters="40" />.  The character count is approximate, based on typical character widths within a proportional font carrying English language text.  Adjust to suit, or request a language-specific adjustment if it is critical.</p>

                <p>This paragraph is intended to make a <tag>fillin</tag> appear right at the start of <fillin characters="20"/> the second line  in print and then the next paragraph has nothing but a <tag>fillin</tag>. Both are for testing purposes.</p>

                <p><fillin characters="5"/></p>

                <p>The following are <tag>fillin</tag> with <attr>rows</attr> and/or <attr>cols</attr> attributes (at least one of which is greater than 1): <fillin rows="2"/>, <fillin cols="3"/>, <fillin rows="2" cols="3"/>.</p>

                <p>Long after we started this mess, we added <pretext /> tags to mark up tags and attributes.  The elements are: <tag>tag</tag>, <tag>tage</tag>, <tag>attr</tag>.  Examples of how these render are (respectively): <tag>section</tag>, <tage>hash</tage>, <attr>width</attr>.  Perhaps this document will make greater use of these tags.</p>

                <p>We supply two provisional cross-references for testing purposes only: <xref provisional="a first incomplete cross-reference"/>, <xref provisional="a second incomplete cross-reference"/>.</p>

            </subsection>

            <conclusion>
                <p>A conclusion here, which we fill with some numbering tests.</p>

                <p>This is a cross-reference to one of the outcomes, forced to use the <c>type-global</c> form of the text.  It should describe the outcome as belonging to the <em>section</em> (rather than the <em>outcomes</em>), since outcomes are one-per-subdivision and are numbered based upon the containing division: <xref ref="outcome-structure" text="phrase-global" />.  For comparison this is the (forced) <c>type-global</c> cross-reference: <xref ref="outcome-structure" text="type-global" />.</p>
            </conclusion>

                <introduction>

            <p><latex /> has a device where you can interrupt a sequence of equations with a small amout of text and preserve the equation alignment on either side.  Here are two tests of that device, with aligned equations and non-aligned equations.  Study the source to see use and differences.  (The math does not make sense.)</p>

            <p>Tables can get quite complex.  Simple ones are simpler, such as this example of numerical computations for Euler's method in just a bit.</p>

            <p>But first we make a figure with two very simple tables next to each other.  This causes the very first instance of <tag>table</tag> to actually be a <q>subtable</q>, which exposes a bug provoked by Emiliano Vega and fixed around 2020-08-06.

            <introduction>
                <p>To be able to create both <latex /> and HTML output (plus variations), we rely on MathJax, which in turn supports an extensive subset of the mathematical symbols normally available.  The AMSMath symbol set is a good approximation.  The <pretext/> Guide has a link to the complete list of macros supported by MathJax.  We load the <c>AMSsymbols</c> library.</p>
            </introduction>


            <subsection>

                <p>The following is from the MathJax <url href="http://www.mathjax.org/demos/tex-samples/" visual="www.mathjax.org/demos/tex-samples/">demonstration page</url>, an identity due to Ramanujan:<me>\frac{1}{\Bigl(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi\Bigr) e^{\frac25 \pi}} = 1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\ldots} } } }</me></p>

                <p>And again, from the MathJax demonstration page, Maxwell's equations:<idx>Maxwell's equations</idx><md>

                </md><notation><usage><m>\nabla</m></usage><description>gradient operator</description></notation></p>

                <p>Historically, we provided internal support for the <latex/> package <c>extpfeil</c>.  As of 2023-10-19 this has become an author election (see the <tag>docinfo</tag> section in the source of this document).  We preeserve a small test that this extensible arrows library is being included properly:<me>A\xmapsto[\text{bijection}]{\Phi+\Psi+\Theta}B</me></p>

                <p>Look back at the top of the source file of this document to see how to include your <tex /> macros just once.  For best results keep your macros simple and semantic.</p>

                <p><pretext/> once provided modest built-in support for <q>slanted</q>, or <q>beveled</q>, or <q>nice</q> fractions.  To wit, we mean fractions such as: <m>\sfrac{3}{8}</m>.  Use the pre-defined <c>\sfrac{}{}</c> macro in your mathematics to achieve this presentation.  The presentation in HTML is subpar, but could improve as MathJax provides support.  It is now an author's responsibility to add support for superior typesetting for <init>PDF</init> output by loading the <c>xfrac</c> <latex/> package with the following in <tag>docinfo</tag>:<cd>
                    <cline>&lt;math-package latex-name="xfrac" mathjax-name=""/&gt;</cline>
                </cd>which is what we have done here as a test.  See the Guide for more details.</p>

                <p>We consider a system of equations.  We number the first and last equation (there are just two) and include an <c>xml:id</c> on each.  We reference the whole system later as the range of equations from the first to the last.<mdn>
                    <mrow xml:id="equation-system-begin">\frac{dx}{dt} \amp = x^2 - 4x - y + 4</mrow>
                    <mrow xml:id="equation-system-end">\frac{dy}{dt} \amp = x^3 - y.</mrow>
                </mdn></p>

            </subsection>

            <subsection>
                <title>Displayed Mathematics</title>

                <p>Multi-line displays of mathematics are achieved with the <c>md</c> tag (<q>math display</q>), and the variant that produces numbers on each line, <c>mdn</c> (<q>math display numbered</q>), used within a paragraph (<c>p</c>).  As a good example of how XML syntax is superior, you author <m>n</m> lines of equations by enclosing each line inside of a <c>mrow</c> tag, rather than using <m>n-1</m> separators (such as <c>\\</c>).</p>

                <p>If you use no ampersands to express alignment (read ahead), then each equation is centered independently on the width of the text.  This is implemented according to the AMSmath <latex /> package's <c>gather</c> environment.  Example:<md>
                    <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 - 4x - y + 4</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} = x^3 - y.</mrow>
                </md></p>

                <p>An ampersand is used, in two ways, to describe positioning several equations per line, organized in columns.  We have created the pre-defined <latex/> macro <c>\amp</c> as one way specify these, but the escape sequence <c>&amp;amp;</c> may be used also.  The second, fourth, sixth, <ellipsis /> ampersands separate columns, and the spacing between columns will be provided automatically.  The first, third, fifth, <ellipsis /> ampersands are alignment points for the equations in each column.  Typically this is placed just prior to a binary operator, such as an equal sign (<c>\amp = </c>), or for a column of explanations or commentary, just prior to the <c>\text{}</c> macro.  Note that this scenario suggests always having an odd number of ampersands in each <c>mrow</c>.  In the example below, alignment is on the equals sign in the first two columns, and provides left-justification to the explanations in the third column.  N.B.: the use below of the <c>\text{}</c> macro does not include mathematics within its argument.  Doing so may yield unpredictable results depending on your choice of delimiters for the mathematics (and using an <c>m</c> tag will be ineffective).<md>
                    <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} \amp = x^2 - 4x - y + 4 \amp \frac{dy}{dt} \amp = x^3 - y          \amp\amp x, y\text{ version}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dw}{dt} \amp = z^3 - w          \amp \frac{dz}{dt} \amp = z^2 - 4z - w + 4 \amp\amp z, w\text{ version}</mrow>
                </md></p>

                <p><pretext /> will automatically detect the presence or absence of ampersands, but by defining macros for entire aligned equations, you can effectively hide the ampersands.  So the <c>@alignment</c> attribute can override automatic detection.  We use a simple <latex /> macro to demonstrate setting <c>alignment='align'</c> to override the use of a <c>gather</c> environment and use a <c>align</c> environment instead.  Example:<md alignment="align">
                    <mrow>\myequation{\frac{dx}{dt}}{x^2 - 4x - y + 4}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\myequation{\frac{dy}{dt}}{x^3 - y}.</mrow>
                </md></p>

                <p>The AMSmath <latex /> package's <c>alignat</c> environment is a third variant of alignment.  It never happens automatically, you need to ask for it with <c>alignment="alignat"</c>.  It is very similar to <c>align</c> but adds no space between the equation columns.  So you can leave it that way, or you can add your own <q>extra</q> space to suit.  Here is a previous example with no inter-column space:<md alignment="alignat">
                    <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} \amp = x^2 - 4x - y + 4 \amp \frac{dy}{dt} \amp = x^3 - y          \amp\amp x, y\text{ version}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dw}{dt} \amp = z^3 - w          \amp \frac{dz}{dt} \amp = z^2 - 4z - w + 4 \amp\amp z, w\text{ version}</mrow>
                </md>.  This modified example has a middle row with three columns, while the other rows have just one column, as a test of our routines for determining the <c>mrow</c> with the greatest number of ampersands (and how many there are),<md alignment="alignat">
                    <mrow>\frac{dw}{dt} &amp;= z^3 - w</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} &amp;= x^2 - 4x - y + 4 &amp; \frac{dy}{dt} &amp;= x^3 - y&amp;&amp; x, y\text{ third column}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\frac{dw}{dt} &amp; = z^3 - w</mrow>
                </md>.  Final example demonstrates that ampersands in other objects (matrices here) can wreak havoc with computing the number of columns.  So we provide yet another attribute to override automatic detection, <c>alignat-columns</c>.  This is the number of <em>columns</em> not the number of <em>ampersands</em>.  Generally, for <m>c</m> columns, there will be <m>2c-1</m> ampersands.<md alignment="alignat" alignat-columns="2">
                    <mrow>A &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 2 \\ 3 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}
                    &amp;
                    I &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}</mrow>
                </md>.  One caveat: if your number of ampersands is even (see advice above about using an odd number) behavior should still be correct, as in next example.</p>

                <p>If you want super-precise control over alignment of the terms of a system of equations (linear or not) you can use the <c>alignat</c> option to advantage by not including any extra space.  This example is modified slightly from a post by Alex Jordan:<md alignment="alignat">
                    <mrow>2x \amp {}+{} \amp  y \amp {}+{} \amp 3z \amp {}={} \amp 10</mrow>

                    <p>In print versions, a long run of displayed equations often needs to be broken across pages.  If you are reading some other version of this, then there is nothing to see here.  But for <latex /> output it could be interesting.  First, with no extra effort, this page-long display should break naturally, no matter how the preceding material changes.<md number="yes">

                    <p>So.  Do not take any extra steps and let <latex /> figure out the breaks.  If you do not like a break, modify the <c>md</c> or <c>mdn</c> to go back to the AMSmath default behavior and not break at all.  Ever.  Or rather, go further and modify an individual <c>mrow</c> to suggest that it is a good place for a break.</p>

                <p>This is a poorly-authored paragaph to test the conversion to <init>HTML</init>.  There are two displayed equations, separated by a period ending the first one's sentence, which should migrate into the display, and not leave behind an empty paragraph: <me>z+y = z</me>.  <me>a + b = c</me>.  This final sentence should remain, inside another <init>HTML</init> paragraph, without the second equation's period.</p>

                <p>If you would like to enhance your mathematics by using a macro from a <latex/> package <em>and</em> there is a MathJax extension <em>which implements the same macro</em>, then you may use this with your mathematics as we demonstrate here.</p>

                <p>This example is from Jason Underdown.<idx><h>Underdown, Jason</h></idx>  The package is named <c>cancel</c> and is included in the TeXLive distribution, so is fairly standard.  The particular macro being demonstrated is <c>\cancelto{}{}</c>.  <me>\lim_{b \rightarrow \infty}\left[\cancelto{0}{-\frac{1}{s}e^{-sb}} + \frac{1}{s}\right]</me>.   Look at the source of this article to see the package name being supplied in a <tag>math-package</tag> element within the <tag>docinfo</tag> section.  That is the only setup required to make the macro usable in <latex/> and <init>HTML</init> output.<idx><h>canceling a term</h></idx><idx sortby="cancelto macro"><c>cancelto</c> macro</idx></p>

                <p>See the <pubtitle><pretext/> Guide</pubtitle> subsection about <q>MathJax Extensions</q> for more detail.</p>

                <title>Advanced Mathematics</title>

                <p>MathJax is extremely capable in rendering a subset of <latex /> in web browsers, and improving all the time.  You can get fairly fancy with some of its supported commands.  In particular, if you need to mix in a few words with your mathematics, the <c>\text{}</c> macro is supported.  For example, you might use an <q>if</q> or an <q>otherwise</q> in the definition of a piecewise function.</p>

                <p>Consider that the first line below is text sandwiched in-between two Greek letters, wrapped in a <c>\text{}</c> macro.  In HTML output we have taken care that the font for text material within display mathematics should match the font of the  surrounding paragraph, as also happens with <latex /> output.  The second line is nearly identical in the source, but is just naked text being rendered like a slew of variables.<md>
                    <mrow>\alpha\text{ is not equal to }\beta</mrow>
                    <mrow>\alpha is not equal to \beta</mrow>
                    <mrow>\alpha\neq\beta</mrow>
                </md>.  We are not suggesting here that using words in place of symbols, as in the first line, is a good practice.  (It is not.)</p>

                <p>The following example is a good stress-test of using the <c>\text{}</c> macro to achieve certain effects.  Note the Unicode left and right smart quotes.  This a contribution from Alex Jordan as part of his work on <pubtitle>APEX Calculus</pubtitle>.<md>
                    <mrow>y \rightarrow \frac{\sin(0) }{0} \rightarrow {{\text{“}}\atop{}}\frac{0}{0}{{\text{”}}\atop{}}\text{.}</mrow>
                </md>And another one from Alex.  Note the use of the <c>\mathord{}</c> and <c>\mathrel{}</c> macros to control spacing around the mathematical symbols.  Examine the source to see how the quotation marks have been authored with <init>XML</init> syntax for Unicode characters, since we do not allow most markup inside mathematics.<md>
                    <mrow>\zeta(1)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}\mathrel{\text{ &#x201c;}\mathord{=}{\text{&#x201d; }}}\prod_{p}\left(\frac{1}{1-1/p}\right)=\prod_{p}\left(\frac{1}{1-p^{-1}}\right)</mrow>

                <p>Generally, you cannot use any <init>XML</init> elements inside of the mathematics elements.  An exception is the <c>xref</c> element which you might want to use to provide justifications for the steps of a derivation.  Here is a visual example that is mathematically meaningless,<md>
                    <mrow>A&amp;=B+C&amp;&amp;<xref ref="corollary-FTC-derivative" text="type-global" /></mrow>
                    <mrow>&amp;=D+E&amp;&amp;<xref ref="theorem-FTC" text="title" /></mrow>
                    <mrow>&amp;=F+G&amp;&amp;<xref ref="theorem-number-01" text="custom">A nice result</xref></mrow>

                <p>Scott Beaver likes to write short chains of equalities all in one line, with the cross-references sitting on each equals sign.  Here we test the <latex/> <c>\overset</c> and <c>\underset</c> macros wrapping a <pretext/> <tag>xref</tag>, with and without content, inside an <tag>me</tag> element.  Note that  <c>\stackrel</c> is obsolete, and <c>\overunderset</c> is not yet supported by MathJax (but see <url href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues/2704" visual="github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues/2704">GitHub #2704</url>).  The mathematics is Scott's, the reasons are totally unrelated to the math.

                        \overset{<xref ref="theorem-FTC" text="global"/>}{=}

                        \underset{<xref ref="definition-indefinite-integral" text="global"/>}{=}
                        A0_{n\times p}

                We suggest using cross-references that only display numbers (<tag>xref</tag> with <attr>text</attr> set to <c>global</c>) since if you stick to elements like <tag>theorem</tag>, <tag>lemma</tag>, <tag>definition</tag>, or <tag>axiom</tag>, then the numbers will be unambiguous and the target of the cross-reference will contain full information.  But note that if you mix in divisions, or perhaps figures, as reasons then there is a possibility that numbers will need to be qualified by their type.  We have provided an abbreviation for one cross-reference to <xref ref="theorem-FTC" text="type-global"/> (which will not benefit from automatic translation to other languages).

                <title>Local Tags on Equations</title>

                <p>If you are not writing a research monograph, maybe (a) you will not use many numbered equations, or do not like the looks of them, or feel they scare your readers, and (b) maybe your cross-references are always local-ish, like strictly within an <c>example</c> or a <c>proof</c>.  For this situation you can create, and employ, a <q>local</q> tag on a displayed equation.  Nothing enforces the idea of what constitutes local, and there is nothing to stop you from using the same symbols more than once.  With freedom comes responsibility.</p>

                <p>Use the <c>@tag</c> attribute on an <c>mrow</c>, only.  (Remember, you can have just one <c>mrow</c>.)  The behavior is identical within an <c>md</c> or <c>mdn</c>.  The value of the <c>@tag</c> attribute is a symbol name.  The prefix <c>d</c> means <q>double</q>, and the prefix <c>t</c> means <q>triple</q>.  So allowed values are<cd>
                    <cline>star, dstar, tstar</cline>
                    <cline>dagger, ddagger, tdagger</cline>
                    <cline>daggerdbl, ddaggerdbl, tdaggerdbl</cline>
                    <cline>hash, dhash, thash</cline>
                    <cline>maltese, dmaltese, tmaltese</cline>
                </cd>Cross-references to these tagged equations happens in the usual way and should behave as expected.  We test the double versions to make sure the symbols render properly in various output formats.<mdn>

We test another farther away in <xref ref="section-cross-referencing" text="type-global" />, contrary to our advice above.</p>

                <p>As of 2021-05-14, in <init>HTML</init> output the next sentence should just fill a full line across the page.  We take active measures to bind the concluding period to the final bit of mathematics, the variable <m>x</m>.  The prevents a bad line break which could see the period <em>begin</em> a new line, all by itself.  In the event that the line-breaking siutation improves, we could relax these measures.  This testing is only relevant to <init>HTML</init> output, not <latex/> output.</p>

            <plaintitle>Entering Text in Paragraphs</plaintitle>

            <introduction>
                <p><init>XML</init>, and therefore <pretext/>, is a markup language.  But by and large, what you type into your source will be what you see in your output.  So there is not much to say.  Except that <xref ref="subsection-xml-escape" text="type-global"/> eventually will be essential.  However we do test various tricky situations here (which have technical explanations we avoid).  See the Author's Guide for a superior treatment of the topics addressed here.</p>
            </introduction>

            <subsection xml:id="subsection-xml-escape">
                <title>Special <init>XML</init> characters</title>

                <p>One of the goals of <pretext/> is to relieve an author of managing the numerous conflicts when mixing languages that use different characters for special purposes.  But, of course, <init>XML</init> has its own special characters.</p>

                <p>If you type a <q>less-than</q> symbol in your source, the <init>XML</init> processor thinks you are starting an opening, or closing, tag.  So how do you get a less-than sign into your source so that it survives into your output, like this: &lt;<nbsp/>?  You use an <term>escaped version</term>.  Type literally, the four characters <c>&amp;lt;</c> in your source.  Then the <init>XML</init> processor will know you want the character and will not mistake it for a tag.  But now we want to get an ampersand into our source like: &amp;.  How?  Another escaped version of a character, literally the five characters <c>&amp;amp;</c>.</p>

                <p>Otherwise, keys on your keyboard, even international versions, should be fine in your source and behave as expected.  <init>WYTIWYG</init> = What You Type Is What You Get.  So the principal concession to using <init>XML</init> markup is the following very simple rule.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Rather than pressing the &lt; and &amp; keys on your keyboard, instead always enter the escape sequences <c>&amp;lt;</c> and <c>&amp;amp;</c> as replacements.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Simple.  And it will work in <q>running text,</q> verbatim text (like when authoring the content of <tag>c</tag> or <tag>pre</tag> elements), and mixed into <latex/> syntax to desribe mathematical expressions.  <init>XML</init> has three other escape sequences <c>&amp;gt;</c>, <c>&amp;apos;</c>, and <c>&amp;quot;</c>, for the characters &gt;, &apos;, and &quot; (respectively).  But they seem largely unnecessary for authoring in PreTeXt, as we now demonstrate by typing them directly from our keyboard into our source: &gt;, &apos;, and &quot;.</p>

                <exercise>
                    <p>How was <c>&amp;amp;</c> authored?  Work it out, and then check the source here for the answer.</p>
                </exercise>
            </subsection>

            <subsection>
                <title>Quotations</title>

                <p>The <tag>q</tag><idx><h>quotations</h></idx> tag will provide beginning and ending double quotations, while the <tag>sq</tag> tag will behave similarly but provide single quotes.  Given the complexity of quotations, the different symbols used in different languages, and the over-simplified versions provided on keyboards, it is necessary to use markup.</p>

                <p><q>The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet.</q> (Aristotle)</p>

                <p><sq>It is always wise to look ahead, but difficult to look further than you can see.</sq> (Winston Churchill)</p>

                <p>A large quote can be accomodated with the <tag>blockquote</tag> tag, which can carry within itself an <tag>attribution</tag> element.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>The problem with writing a book in verse is, to be successful, it has to sound like you knocked it off on a rainy Friday afternoon. It has to sound easy. When you can do it, it helps tremendously because it's a thing that forces kids to read on. You have this unconsummated feeling if you stop.</p>
                    <attribution>Dr. Seuss</attribution>
                </blockquote>

                <p>We say that again, to test a multiline attribution of a block quotation.  Notice how the dash appears automatically, and that it is a <term>quotation dash</term> in HTML, distinct from other sorts of dashes.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>The problem with writing a book in verse is, to be successful, it has to sound like you knocked it off on a rainy Friday afternoon. It has to sound easy.

                        <line>Dr. Seuss</line>

                    </attribution>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Sometimes a quote may extend across several paragraphs.  Or a balanced pair of quotations marks crosses an XML boundary, so we need left, right, single and double versions.  (For example, see Section<nbsp /><xref ref="poetry" /> on poetry.)  Here are all four in a haphazard order: <rq />, <lsq />, <lq />, <rsq />.  These should be a last resort, and <em>not</em> a replacement for the <c>q</c> and <c>sq</c> tags.  The left/right versions are used for the following quote from Abraham Lincoln, which we have edited into two paragraphs.</p>

                <p><lq />I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true. I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live by the light that I have.</p>

                <p>I must stand with anybody that stands right, and stand with him while he is right, and part with him when he goes wrong.<rq /></p>

                <p>And as a tests, we try some crazy combinations of quotes, which would normally give <latex /> some trouble where the quotation marks are adjacent.<ul>
                    <li><p><q>we use <sq>single quotes inside of double quotes</sq></q></p></li>
                    <li><p><sq><q>double quotes inside of single quotes</q> with more</sq></p></li>
                    <li><p><q><sq>single quotes tight inside of double quotes</sq></q></p></li>
                    <li><p><sq><q>double quotes tight inside of single quotes</q></sq></p></li>
                    <li><p>An <q><sq><sq><q>absurd test</q></sq></sq></q> of two adjacent single quotes inside a pair of double quotes</p></li>
                    <li><p>you would never do this, but a <sq><sq>pair of single quotes</sq></sq></p></li>
                </ul></p>

                <p><abbr>N.B.</abbr> We have taken no special care to protect against interactions of the actual quote characters (described above) in <latex /> with themselves, or with the grouping tags.</p>
            </subsection>

            <subsection>
                <title>Groupings</title>

                <p>It is possible to make some other groupings like quotations, such as {some <em>emphasized text</em> grouped within braces}, or [a <pubtitle>Book Title</pubtitle> inside brackets], an <articletitle>Article Title</articletitle>, <angles>some <foreign>foreign words</foreign> inside angle brackets</angles>, or <dblbrackets>just a bit of text within double brackets</dblbrackets>.  Some of these are used extensively by scholars who study texts to note various restorations or deletions.  Note that the <tag>foreign</tag> element may have a <c>xml:lang</c> attribute.</p>

                <p>Note that the angle brackets, <langle/> and <rangle/>, are <em>not</em> the keyboard characters, &lt; and &gt;.  Your best bet is to use the provided <tag>angles</tag> element when constructing a balanced pair.  Similarly, <tag>dblbrackets</tag> is provided to make the double-bracket characters easily available, since they are likely not on your keyboard.</p>
            </subsection>

            <subsection>
                <title>Characters, Symbols, and Constructions</title>

                <p>Some keyboard characters are ambiguous.  Is the character <c>'</c> an apostrophe or a right single quote?  We presume the former, ', and provide markup as an alternative for the latter (described above).  Is <c>/</c> used to separate words, or to form a fraction?  We presume the former, /, and provide <tage>solidus</tage>, <solidus/>, for the latter.  We test some other characters straight from our US keyboard (with two being escape sequences).</p>

                <p>~ ` ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * ( ) _ - + = [ ] { } | \ ; : ' " , &lt; . > ? /</p>

                <p>And again  as verbatim text.</p>

                <p><c>~ ` ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * ( ) _ - + = [ ] { } | \ ; : ' " , &lt; . > ? /</c></p>

                <p>Note that for a long time <pretext/> had empty elements for many of these characters, as a consequence of naïveté.  So you might see <tage>dollar</tage>, <tage>ampersand</tage>, or others in old source.  They will be deprecated and will raise warnings.</p>

                <p>Now, when a character is nowhere to be found on your keyboard, we provide conveniences as markup.  Or a keyboard character may have a different variant which we implement as an empty element.  Here we test many of these.  Read the Author's Guide for tags and more detail.</p>

                <p>There are a few  common abbreviations of Latin phrases that can be achieved in HTML one way, and in <latex /> with a slightly different mechanism.  These are due to <latex />'s treatment of a period (full stop), depending on its surroundings.  So not reserved characters, but just divergent treatment.  Using these will lead to the best quality in all your outputs.  See Will Robertson's informative and arcane <url href="http://latex-alive.tumblr.com/post/827168808/correct-punctuation-spaces" visual="latex-alive.tumblr.com/post/827168808">blog post</url> on the topic if you want the full story for the treatment of a full stop in <latex />.</p>

                    <p>When processing a <latex/> file with <c>xelatex</c> the Font Awesome 5 icons are expected to be in a <em>system</em> font whose name is <c>Font Awesome 5 Free</c>.  This is not a filename, and installing the <latex/> <c>fontawesome5</c> package into your <latex/> installation does not always guarantee that this font will automatically be available as a <em>system</em> font.</p>

                    <p>The Publisher's Guide contains some discussion about installing fonts into a system, as part of the documentation of creating a <latex/> style, and has particular warnings about only using the <latex/> <c>fontawesome5</c> package as a vehicle for installing and accessing these fonts.</p>

                <idx>keyboard keys</idx>

                <p>Your text can include specialized text meant to look like a key on the keyboard of a calculator or other device.  So you can go <kbd>b</kbd> <kbd>Enter</kbd> <kbd>&lt;</kbd> or <kbd>F1</kbd>.  Or maybe a sequence as: <kbd>Tab</kbd> &gt; <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> &gt; <kbd>T</kbd>.  Use the <tag>kbd</tag> element, with the label of the key as content.</p>

                <p>There is a growing supply of keys which are labeled with graphics rather than text, such as a left arrow <kbd name="left"/>, right arrow <kbd name="right"/>, up arrow <kbd name="up"/>, down arrow <kbd name="down"/>, and Enter <kbd name="enter"/>.  See <pubtitle>The <pretext/> Guide</pubtitle> for the definitive list.  In <xref ref="named-keyboard-keys"/> the literal column means the symbol/character is the content of a <tag>kbd</tag> element, while the named column means the symbol/character has been chosen via the value of the <attr>name</attr> attribute of an empty <tage>kbd</tage> element.</p>

            <subsection xml:id="section-urls">
                <title>URLs, such as <url href="http://example.com" /></title>
                <idx><h>link</h><h>external, url</h></idx>
                <idx><h>reference</h><h>external, url</h></idx>

                <p>The <tag>url</tag> element can be used to create an external reference.  The mandatory <attr>href</attr> attribute is the actual <init>URL</init> complete with the protocol (e.g. <c>https://</c>).  Content for the element is optional, and if provided will be the <q>clickable</q> text.  In this case, a <attr>visual</attr> attribute can be provided, and this will become a footnote with a more friendly version of the <init>URL</init>.  When no content is provided, the <q>clickable</q> will be the <init>URL</init> with a preference for an optional <attr>visual</attr>.  This subsection has some (extreme) tests and we leave complete documentation and full details for the <pretext/> Guide.</p>

                <p>A long <init>URL</init> for testing:  <url href="http://www.pcc.edu/enroll/registration/dropping.html#withdraw" visual="www.pcc.edu/enroll/registration/dropping.html#withdraw"/>.  Notice in the source that you <em>do not</em> put any tags inside the <attr>href</attr> or <attr>visual</attr> attributes, but you may need to provide XML escape sequences (see <xref ref="subsection-xml-escape" text="type-global"/>). </p>

                <p>A <tag>url</tag> element with content will get a footnote, by containing the (simplified) URL in the highly-recommended <attr>visual</attr> attribute.  If you do not provide the <attr>visual</attr> attribute in this case, then you will get the <attr>href</attr> value repeated, possibly with some editing.  If you insist, you can make the <attr>visual</attr> attribute identical to the <attr>href</attr> attribute.  Some tests:<ul>
                    <li><url href="http://example.com/" visual="example.com">With a useful <attr>visual</attr> attribute</url></li>
                    <li><url href="http://example.com/" visual="http://example.com/">With a duplicate <attr>visual</attr> attribute</url></li>
                    <li><url href="http://example.com/">With no <attr>visual</attr> attribute</url>, so an edited one is formulated (no protocol)</li>
                </ul></p>

                <p>Here is a totally bogus <init>URL</init>, which contains every possible legal character, so if this fails to convert there is some problematic character.  In order to test the use of a percent sign (<c>%</c>) in a URL, we follow it by two hex digits, specifically, <c>58</c>, which is a way to represent the character <c>X</c> in a <init>URL</init>.  Normal text, monospace text, <tag>url</tag> with just <attr>href</attr>, <tag>url</tag> with <attr>href</attr> and <attr>visual</attr>, <tag>url</tag> with <attr>href</attr>, <attr>visual</attr> and content.  Notice how the various versions do, or do not, line-break in <latex/>/PDF output, including the (potentially confusing) use of a use of a hyphen in the normal text version</p>

                This paragraph has two footnotes, one with a real URL from Jesse Oldroyd, another with a fake URL from the above suite.
                For good measure, we repeat the URL found in the first footnote (which lacks its own footnote by design<fn>And if you do provide a link like <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carleson%27s_theorem" visual="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carleson%27s_theorem">Carleson's Theorem</url> in a footnote, provide an easy-to-read reference, such as <c>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carleson%27s_theorem</c> since the extra footnote and any visual will be squelched.</fn>):
                <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carleson%27s_theorem" visual="">Carleson's Theorem</url>.
                And we include a no-content version of the same link, with a visual version provided and employed:

                <p>The <c>taxon</c><idx>taxon</idx><idx><h>biological names</h><h>taxon</h></idx> element can be used all by itself to get an italicized scientific name, as in <taxon>Escherichia coli</taxon>.

Or the subelements can be used individually.  Rules for capitalization are presently your responsibility as an author.  Possible improvements include new subelements, attributes for database identifiers, and checks on capitalization.  Also, we might automatically abbreviate the genus after first use.</p>

                <p>There is an attribute, <c>@ncbi</c><idx>ncbi attribute</idx><idx><h>attributes</h><h>ncbi attribute</h></idx><idx><h>biological names</h><h>ncbi attribute</h></idx> that you can use on the <c>taxon</c> element to precisely identify the organism you are discussing using an identification number from the <url href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" visual="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">National Center for Biotechnology Information</url>.  Their <url href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy" visual="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy">taxonomy</url> is at <c>www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy</c>.  Right now, we do not do anything with this attribute, but things like links are certainly possible.  See the source of this document to see it in use with <taxon ncbi="7229"><genus>Drosophila</genus><species>miranda</species></taxon> which could be used to construct a link to <url href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=7229" visual="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=7229">further information via id number</url> or even <url href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?name=Drosophila+miranda" visual="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?name=Drosophila+miranda">further information via just the name</url>.</p>

                </sage>

                <p>There is an alternate Sage syntax, which avoids the less-than and greater symbols.</p>

                <sage>
                    <input>
                    R = ZZ['u']
                    u = R.gen(0)
                    (u, R)
                    </input>
                    <output>(u, Univariate Polynomial Ring in u over Integer Ring)</output>
                </sage>

                <p>Ampersands, less-than, and greater symbols are likely to be necessary in source code, such as Sage code (think generators of field extensions) or TikZ code (think arrowheads), and in matrices (think separating entries).  If you have a big matrix, or a huge chunk of TikZ code, you can protect it all at once from the XML processor by wrapping it in <c>&lt;![CDATA[</c><nbsp/><nbsp/><nbsp/><c>]]&gt;</c>.  It should be possible to write without ever using the <q>CDATA</q> mechanism, but it might get tedious in places to use the supplied macros or <init>XML</init> escape sequences.  This construction is often mis-understood as a solution better remedied by reading <xref ref="subsection-xml-escape" text="type-global"/> again.</p>

                <p>We test the three pre-defined <latex /> macros for &amp;, &lt;, and &gt; with a pair of aligned equations:<md>
                    <mrow>a^2 + b^2\amp\lt c^2</mrow>
                    <mrow>c^2\amp\gt a^2 + b^2</mrow>

                <p>A Jupyter notebook allows a mix of <init>HTML</init> (our logistical preference for a conversion) and Markown (another set of special characters and their escaped versions).  Certain pairs of delimiters, when appearing in consecutive <init>HTML</init> <tag>code</tag> elements require extraordinary care.  But the one nut we cannot crack is pairs of dollar signs.

            <subsection>
                <title><latex/> Characters, Ligatures, and More</title>

                <p>This section is just for testing, and the more you know about <latex/>, the more we would encourage you to <em>not</em> to read this.  Look to the Author's Guide for the <em>right</em> way to author your source.</p>

                <p>The ten reserved characters, directly in the source: # $ % ^ &amp; _ { } ~ \.  And again: X#X$X%X^X&amp;X_X{X}X~X\X, but smashed up tight to intermediate characters.</p>

                <p>In a verbatim presentation: <c># $ % ^ &amp; _ { } ~ \</c>.</p>

                <p>And <c>X#X$X%X^X&amp;X_X{X}X~X\X</c>.  (These verbatim versions are authored in different paragraphs to work around the Jupyter notebook bug described above.)</p>

                <p>We also disrupt certain constructions from <latex/>.  Attempting to sneak-in any traditional macro for the purposes of <latex/>-only output, such as, say a \newpage, will fail since the leading backslash will be caught and converted to <c>\textbackslash</c>.  (See?  It just happened twice.)  For technical reasons we want to particularly test \textbackslash, \textbraceleft, and \textbraceright.</p>

                <p>Four <q><tex/> ligatures</q>, <c>--</c>, <c>---</c>, <c>``</c>, and <c>''</c>, authored in running text, --, ---, ``, ''.  It may be hard to tell that the two consecutive apostrophes have not coalesced into a curly left smart quote, but see below, the spacing is subtly different.</p>

                <p>We want the double quote mark from your keyboard, <c>"</c>, to not morph into some other character: "<nbsp/>.</p>

                <p>More testing: runs of hyphens.  Such as: - (one), -- (two), --- (three), ---- (four), ----- (five), ------ (six), ------- (seven).  Use the empty elements <tage>ndash</tage> and <tage>mdash</tage> for the longer dashes/hyphens.</p>

                <p>Runs of apostrophes should not become smart right double quotes:  ' (one), '' (two), ''' (three), '''' (four), ''''' (five), '''''' (six), ''''''' (seven).    You might want to cut-and-paste these into a text file to convince yourself there are the right number of characters.  Here are two smart right double quotes, separated by a non-breaking space, for visual comparison: <rq/><nbsp/><rq/>.  Or 30 apostrophes on a line of their own (longer) followed by 15 smart right double quotes (shorter).</p>
                <p>''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''.</p>
                <p><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/><rq/>.</p>

                <p>Runs of backticks (accent grave) should not become smart left double quotes when the output is processed by <latex/>:  ` (one), `` (two), ``` (three), ```` (four), ````` (five), `````` (six), ``````` (seven).  Furthermore, in a context where Markdown syntax is recognized as well (<eg/> a Jupyter notebook), paired backticks should <em>not</em> produce `inline verbatim text`.</p>

                <p>The next paragraph has a long run of words separated/joined by the keyboard forward-slash character.  With this input, <latex/> will not line-break at the slash, nor will it hypenate anywhere.  <pretext/>  automatically provides an improved slash, which will line-break, as you should see below in <latex/> output.  There is a bad right margin, but that is due to the absurdity of this test.  This sort of problem should be no better or worse for the use of this character.  Further refinements (zero-width space) and packages can be used to get hyphenation.  <init>HTML</init> will line-break rationally with no extra help.  Remember the <tage>solidus</tage> character for super-simple text fractions like 7<solidus/>32 (which will <em>not</em> line-break), and math elements or SI unit markup for technical work.</p>

                <title><init>HTML</init> and accidental mathematics</title>

                <p>We render mathematics in web pages with the fantastic MathJax Javascript library.  Simplifying just a bit, it recognizes <latex/> syntax within a page, takes control of that text, and replaces it wth nice fonts and formatting.  Now, if you write about <latex/> you might well have some mathematics in your examples.  Best practice would be to use verbatim text for that, and we mark off such text as being off-limits to MathJax.</p>

                <p>But if you are writing running text, then you can (accidentally) author some text which MathJax recognizes and converts to something (unintended).  And if you are doing this intentionally, then you have ignored <pretext/> markup for mathematics, and are missing out on some features.</p>

                <p>A few tests that we can prevent any accidents.</p>

                <p>Inline mathematics: \(x^2\).</p>

                <p>Display mathematics: \begin{align}x^2+y^2=z^2\end{align}</p>

                <p>Double backticks is a common <latex/> construction, which in <latex/>/PDF output <em>should not</em> become an opening quote-mark.  Also, a single backtick in HTML is a signal for MathJax to interpret ASCIIMath, and then a double backtick causes <q>random</q> pieces of mathematics on a page to not render at all.  So we have a quotation authored <latex/>-style: ``We have nothing to fear, but fear itself.''</p>

                <p>In addition to including images created externally (e.g. photographs),  <pretext/> supports several languages for describing diagrams and pictures with human-readable source code (<ie /> plain text), rather than using a <q>paint</q> program.

                <title>Images from External Sources</title>

                <p>If you have raster images (photographs, etc.) then they are specified with complete filenames, as above in Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-function-derivative"/> or just below.</p>

                <figure>

                <p>If you have existing images that are vector graphics, then PDF format works best for <latex/> output and SVG format works best for HTML.  The utility <c>pdf2svg</c> works well for converting PDF to SVG.  In this case, specify your source as a filename, but leave off the file extension, and the appropriate version will be used for the current output format.</p>

                <p>The image below is provided from a PDF file in <latex/> output, and was converted to an SVG for use with the HTML output.  It has been explicitly scaled to a width of 65% of the text width.</p>

                <idx><h>image</h><h><prefigure/> image</h></idx>

                <p><prefigure/> is a standalone project for authoring mathematical diagrams (see <url href="https://prefigure.org/" visual="prefigure.org"/>).  Its philosophy and approach are much like that of <pretext/>, and <prefigure/> is tightly integrated into <pretext/>.  One key feature is excellent support for the creation of accessible output formats.</p>

                <p>As of 2024-11-06 development continues for <prefigure/> itself, and fine-tuning of its integration within <pretext/>.  But it is usable now for projects that want to use it.<ul>
                    <li>You can author <prefigure/> diagrams, and then generate <init>SVG</init>, <init>PDF</init>, and <init>PNG</init> output versions with the <c>pretext/pretext</c> script (see the <pretext/> Guide), and expect them to render in <init>HTML</init>, <init>PDF</init>, and <init>EPUB</init> output formats.</li>
                    <li>Look for automatic generation to come to the <pretext/>-CLI sometime very soon.</li>
                    <li><prefigure/> has excellent support for annotations within an <init>SVG</init> diagram, supporting their use by screenreaders, for example.  See an example below.</li>
                    <li>Production of tactile versions is now possible, though they are not incorporated explicitly into any of the output formats.  Perhaps they will become available via archive links or as a zip archive.</li>
                </ul></p>

                <p>This is a basic <prefigure/> diagram, in the sense that it does not use all the features of <prefigure/> or <pretext/>.</p>

                <p>Including annotations enables a new type of interactive diagram within a <pretext/> document offering potential benefits for all readers.  In particular, annotations allow an author to call the reader's attention to specific details in a diagram and how they are related to one another so that the diagram and surrounding text are more tightly integrated.  The annotated diagram below introduces Fibonacci tilings, which are one-dimensional analogs of Penrose tilings, and offers an explanation of their aperiodicity.  Of course, surrounding text would usually provide a richer context for a diagram like this.</p>

                <p>For sighted readers, here is an example of a tactile version of one of the above diagrams.  It is generated automatically from the same source as the other version.  Imagine this being <q>printed</q> with an embosser so that the parts of the diagram, and the braille labels, are raised up from the paper and can be explored with one's fingertips.  This image is a <init>PNG</init> produced specifically for this document.  Typically, a tactile diagram produced by <prefigure/> will be a <init>PDF</init> ready to be sent to an appropriate embosser.  Notice that <pretext/> adds a caption indicating the diagram's location in the document along the top of the diagram.</p>

                <p>There are several graphics engine packages that a <latex/> document can employ. Code from these packages renders diagrams automatically as part of normal processing of <latex/> files.  For HTML output the <c>pretext</c> script produces SVG versions of the pictures.  The script can also produce standalone <tex/> source files, PDFs, PNGs, and EPSs. The packages should be loaded in <c>docinfo/latex-image-preamble</c>, which is also where global package settings should be made. If any ampersands occur in your <latex/> code you should use the <c>\amp</c> macro pre-defined by <pretext/>. These first examples are from the <url href="http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/" visual="www.texample.net/tikz/examples/">TeXample.net</url> site.  Note that any <latex /> macros used in the rest of your document may be employed in the <latex/>-standalone or Asymptote diagrams (with this feature coming to Sage graphics next?).</p>

                <p>A plot might use a graphics language to draw the axes and grid, but the data might be from an experiment and live in an external file that you do not wish to place in your source.  Place such a file in a subdirectory directly below the directory where your master source file resides.  In the example below <c>data</c> is the directory and <c>hodgkin-huxley-data.dat</c> is the file with the data points.  You <em>must</em> place the file in a subdirectory (it cannot reside next to your source file), but that directory may have subdirectories if you have many such files and want to organize them that way.  Then the <c>--include</c> command-line argument to the <c>pretext</c> script will manage the external files properly as it creates individual image files.</p>

                <p>It is still your responsibility to be sure this directory of external data files follows your <latex /> output to whatever directory you use to convert to a PDF and is in the right location for the relative path given in the XML source.  The discussion above only applies to generating individual image files, such as you would need for the HTML output.</p>

                <p>PSTricks is a <latex /> package for drawing diagrams and pictures, dating back to the days before <init>PDF</init>, when PostScript (<init>PS</init>) was king.  Given its history, it does not seem to work easily with the <c>pdflatex</c> engine.  But it will work easily with the <c>xelatex</c> engine.  We try to keep this present sample document workable with both engines, so we have presented an example of the use of PSTricks in the <c>xelatex</c>-exclusive sample document where we test obscure fonts and characters.  So your best bet is to look there.<idx>PSTricks</idx></p>

                <p>There are suggestions online that <cd>\usepackage[pdf]{pstricks}</cd>along with <cd>pdflatex --shell-escape *.tex</cd> is workable.  We could not make it happen, and a <q>shell escape</q> can be a dangerous security hole.  That said, updates to this approach are welcome.</p>

Zooming in and out can be accomplished with a mouse wheel, or by pinching.  As a contribution to the accessibility of <pretext/> HTML output, keyboard controls will also allow for exploration of these images.

As you rotate the image, notice how the reflection of the light source varies, along with the brightness of various regions of the surface.  This example is accomplished with just 10 lines of Asymptote code.</p>

                <title>Sage Plots</title>
                <idx><h>Sage plots</h></idx>

                <p>Any of the numerous capabilities of Sage may be used to produce any graphics object, be it the simple graph of a single-variable function or some realization of a more complicated object.  All of the usual rules about formatting Sage code (esp. indentation) apply, along with one more caveat.  The last line of your Sage code <alert>must</alert> return a Sage <c>Graphics</c> object (or 3D plot).  The <c>pretext</c> script will isolate this last line, use it as the RHS of an assignment statement, and the Sage <c>.save()</c> method will be called to generate the image, which is either a Portable Document Format (PDF) file amenable to <latex /> output, or a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file amenable to HTML output.  For visualizations of 3D plots, Sage will only produce Portable Network Graphics (PNG) files, which can be included in HTML pages or <latex /> output.  For complete documentation, see the <pretext/> Guide as this subsection is not comprehensive.</p>

                <figure xml:id="figure-sage-parabola">
                    <caption>A Sage standard parabola, on <m>[-2,4]</m></caption>
                    <image xml:id="sageplot-parabola" width="50%">

                        <sageplot>
                        f(x) = x^2
                        plot(f, (x, -2, 4), color='green', thickness=3)
                        </sageplot>
                    </image>
                </figure>

                <p>Pay careful attention to the requirement that the last line of your code be a graphics object.  In particular, while <c>show()</c> might appear to do the right thing, it evaluates to Python's <c>None</c> object and that is just what you will get.  The code for Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-sage-double-plot" /> illustrates creating two graphics objects and combining them into an expression on the last line that evaluates to a graphics object.</p>

                <p>From the Sage documentation, with slight modifications, credited to Douglas Summers-Stay.  A plot of the implicity defined surface <me>2 = \cos(x + ty) + \cos(x - ty) + \cos(y + tz) + \cos(y - tz) + \cos(z - tx) + \cos(z + tx)</me> in rectangular <m>xyz</m> coordinates, with <m>t</m> equal to the golden ratio.  If you set <c>plot_points=100</c> in the Sage code, you will get a very smooth rendering, but also a quite large <init>HTML</init> file.  We have used <c>plot_points=50</c> to reduce the file size by a factor of four.  Note the need for a value of <c>3d</c> for the <attr>variant</attr> attribute, and an explicit aspect ratio with <attr>aspect</attr>.  Arrow keys, a mouse scroll wheel, plus grabbing with a left or a right mouse button, can be used to manipulate the image.</p>

                <title>Inkscape Images</title>

                <p><url href="https://inkscape.org/" visual="inkscape.org">Inkscape</url> is a great tool for creating images.  It ticks all the boxes: open source, mature, cross-platform, standards-compliant.  Read much more about it in The <pretext/> Guide.  In <init>HTML</init> output the two images below are both in <init>SVG</init> format.  The first is <q>pure</q> SVG, while the second has embedded information that makes it easier to edit in Inkscape.  You could view the source for this page in the <init>HTML</init> version, deduce the filename of the second image, download it, and manipulate it profitably with Inkscape.  Both files are quite small, but the first is half the size of the second.  In <init>PDF</init> the two images come from files that are identical, so nothing is being tested.  The <init>PDF</init> version is smaller still.</p>

                <title>Copies of Images</title>

                <p>Sometimes you want to use the same image more than once.  Here we just point to a <init>PNG</init> file that we repeat often throughout this sample.</p>

                <figure xml:id="figure-raster-image-copy">
                    <caption>Copy of raster image, in a figure, so now numbered and captioned</caption>
                    <image source="images/cross-square.png" width="30%" />
                </figure>

                <p>For images described by code, such as TikZ code in a <tag>latex-image</tag> element, this is a bit subtler.  See the <pretext/> Guide for a complete description.  We also demonstrate this with the sample book, since it is all set up with the <c>xinclude</c> mechanism.  See the two plots of the 8-th roots of unity in the complex numbers section of the chapter on cyclic groups.</p>

                <title>Caption Testing</title>

                <p>A caption could be as substantial as a paragraph, here we test out one such example.</p>

                <figure xml:id="figure-long-caption">
                    <caption>A caption can be a whole paragraph with lots of technical details, and maybe a hyperlink to something external, such as <url href="https://pretextbook.org" visual="pretextbook.org"/> or <url href="https://pretextbook.org" visual="pretextbook.org"><pretext/></url>.  There could be some inline mathematics, such as <m>x^2 + y^2 = c^2</m>.  Would a knowl open here?  Recursively?  Let's see: <xref ref="figure-long-caption" />.  Display mathematics, side-by-sides, theorems, and lots of other things should be banned.  Footnotes sound like a bad idea.  Strange characters should be fine: <section-mark />.</caption>

                    <image source="images/cross-square.png" width="20%" />
                </figure>
            </subsection>

            <subsection xml:id="captionless-images">
                <title>Captionless Images</title>

                <p>We strongly suggest placing images within a <tag>figure</tag>, as we have done above, so that you can reference them, and use the (required) <tag>caption</tag> to explain what they are.  However there are places, such as a <tag>preface</tag>, where numbered items are not permitted.  So you might want a solo image there.  Or maybe graphics are an illustration of sorts, and a numbered figure feels like overkill.  Or it is part of an <tag>exercise</tag> or <tag>proof</tag> of a <tag>theorem</tag>. But notice that you cannot then use this image as the target of a cross-reference, so you may need to refer to some enclosing container.</p>

                <p>The image can be scaled by specifying the <attr>width</attr> as a percentage, including the percent-sign (%).  The height is scaled to preserve the aspect ratio.  There is no facility to change the height, it is your responsibility to manage the aspect ratio independently.  The <attr>margins</attr> can be given as a pair of percentages, separated by a space.  The <attr>width</attr> defaults to 100%, while <attr>margins</attr> defaults to the value <c>auto</c>, which will center the image.  Missing values are computed sensibly, and there is robust error-checking.  The layout control here is a subset of what is available for the more elaborate <tag>sidebyside</tag> element, see <xref ref="section-side-by-side" text="type-global"/>.</p>

                <p>Two simple examples. The first has width <c>10%</c> and so defaults to being centered, and the second has width <c>10%</c> and left margin of <c>25%</c>.</p>

                <image source="images/cross-square.png" width="10%"/>

                <p>A paragraph, just to show where the first stops and the second ends.</p>

                <image source="images/cross-square.png" width="10%" margins="25% 65%"/>

                <p>You might wish to place a single image flush-left, or flush-right.  You can specify the <c>margins</c> attribute as a pair of percentages for different left and right margins.  The following are laid out with two margins, with a 0% left margin and right margin (respectively). </p>

                <image source="images/cross-square.png" width="10%" margins="0% 90%"/>

                <image source="images/cross-square.png" width="10%" margins="90% 0%"/>

                <p>We place two images right above one another, to test spacing of consecutive images (provided they stay on the same page!).</p>

                <image source="images/cross-square.png" width="10%" margins="10% 80%"/>

                <image source="images/cross-square.png" width="10%" margins="10% 80%"/>

                    <p>All the images above are specified by filenames.  We need to test how various options behave when incorporated into the (new) implementation for images, being introduced with solo images.</p>

                <p>The table below is a summary of how graphics and images are specified, constructed and manipulated.  Additional processing is indicated by reference to the Python script <c>pretext</c>.  Images need to be placed relative to the <latex /> file that includes them during compilation, and placed relative to the <init>HTML</init> files which reference/include them.  Author-provided image files may be placed in any subdirectory, and the <c>@source</c> attribute should include the complete relative path with the subdirectory.  Files generated by the <c>pretext</c> script will be specified in the output using the relative directory <c>images</c>, which can be changed.  There is no reason author-provided files cannot also be placed in this same directory (presuming no duplicate names). [This table is presently more readable in HTML, the PDF version will improve.]</p>

                <p>In the early stages of a writing project, it may be best not to track provisional image files built with <c>pretext</c> under version control, and just regenerate them periodically (see the <c>-r</c> option for <c>pretext</c>).  As a project matures, then it makes sense to put stable files under version control for collaborators and others.  In every case, managing graphics files (and other aspects of production), is much more pleasurable with a script (shell, Makefile, etc.)</p>

                <p>In a longer work you might wish to have some references on a per-chapter basis, or similar.  You can make a <q>references</q> subdivision anywhere to hold bibliographic items, and you can reference the items like any other item.  For example, we can cite the article below <xref ref="biblio-beezer-fcla" detail="Chapter R" />, included an indication that a specific chapter may be relevant.</p>

                <p>This section contains nested lists,
                   to demonstrate how they get assigned labels (numbering, symbols).
                   But we begin with two simple lists,
                   demonstrating an ordered list and an unordered list.
                   See the end of section for an example of a description list.
                   Note in the source the optional use of a paragraph
                   (<c>p</c>) for the list items of the list of colors.</p>

                <p><ol>
                    <li>First.</li>
                    <li>Second<fn>Footnote in an unstructured list item</fn>.</li>
                    <li>Third.</li>
                </ol><ul>
                    <li><p>Red<fn>One of our favorite colors</fn></p></li>
                    <li><p>Green</p></li>
                    <li><p>Yellow</p></li>
                    <li><p>Purple</p></li>
                </ul></p>

                <p>Next, we have a list with no customization and multiple levels to test the defaults.  <latex /> allows a maximum of four levels of ordered/numbered lists, and a total of six levels if some unordered lists are mixed in.  Note that to have nested lists you <em>must</em> structure your list items as paragraphs, since a list may only appear within a <tag>p</tag> element.<ol>

                                </ol></p>

                            </ol></p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <title>A title on a nested item</title>
                                <p>Level 2, third.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol></p>
                    </li>

                </ol></p>

                <p>Items in ordered lists (only) may be be give an <c>xml:id</c> and then may be the target of an <c>xref</c>.  We test three here, referencing down into the hierarchy above.  Level 1, second: <xref ref="list-two" />.  Level 3, second: <xref ref="list-two-two-two" />.  Level 4, third: <xref ref="list-two-two-two-three" />.  Note that if a list item of an ordered list is contained within a list item of an unordered list, then its number will not be defined.</p>

                <p>And now a four-level deep unordered list with the default labels supplied by <pretext/> (disc, circle, square, disc).  Again, the defalt order for Markdown/Jupyter (disc, square, circle, circle) is different than for <latex /> and HTML (disc, circle, square, disc)<ul>

                <p>Exercises and References are specialized subdivisions you can put anywhere.  They are implemented as top-level lists, so should share behavior.  For example, an exercise may have many parts and when expressed as a list, should have the expected labels.</p>

                  <p>
                    There are many places where it makes sense to have a list of mathematical terms,
                    or possibly equations.
                    For example, one might wish to provide a list of derivative formulas.
                    With such lists, the author may wish to have display mathematics,
                    but almost certainly they don't want it centered.
                    One can work around this by using the <latex/> <c>\displaystyle</c> command.
                    However, it would be nice if a list item containing only math used display mode by default.

                <p>In <xref ref="test-second" text="type-global"/> we were careful about lone bits of math inside list items.  The <tag>cd</tag> element is used with indentation, which is likely superfluous inside a list item that is already being indented.  Here we test lone <tag>cd</tag> elements inside of list items in various configurations.</p>

                <p>Unordered list, one-deep.

                <title>Description Lists</title>

                <p>Use <c>dl</c> to make a description list<idx><h>description list</h></idx><idx><h>list</h><h>description</h></idx>. Inside of those tags, use <c>li</c> for each entry. Then, use <c>title</c> to specify the term being described and <c>p</c> to specify the description.</p>
                <p>A <q>description</q> list
                <idx><h>description list</h></idx><idx><h>list</h><h>description</h></idx>
                has a short term or phrase that is prominent, followed by a short description.  It is modeled on the lists of similar structure in both <latex /> and HTML.  It makes for a nice medium-weight way to define terms, somewhere in-between the <c>term</c> tag which just makes a term prominent in a sentence, and a <c>definition</c>, which is set off, has a heading, a number, and a title.  Do not try to manage the separation between the title and the description by employing punctuation (but you can include a question-mark or exclamation-point if necessary).  For example, do not include a colon to the end of the title.  This example is from Bob Plantz.
                <dl>
                    <li xml:id="cpu-definition">
                        <title>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</title>
                        <p>Controls most of the activities of the computer, performs the arithmetic and logical operations, and contains a small amount of very fast memory.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <title>Memory</title>
                        <p>Provides storage for the instructions for the CPU and the data they manipulate.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <title>Input/Output (I/O)</title>
                        <p>Communicates with the outside world and with mass storage devices (<eg />, disks).</p>
                    </li>

                    <li xml:id="bus-definition">
                        <title>Bus!</title>
                        <p>A communication pathway with a protocol specifying exactly how the pathway is used. (The punctuation is just for testing.)</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <title><m>\displaystyle \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n = \frac{1}{1-x}</m></title>
                        <p>A geometric series.  The formula is valid if <m>|x| &lt; 1</m>.</p>
                    </li>
                </dl></p>

                <p>Some presentations can be assisted by a hint from the author about the lengths of the titles.  You can choose to provide a <c>width</c> attribute on a <c>dl</c> element with possible values <c>narrow</c> and <c>medium</c>. The value refers (somewhat confusingly) to the distance between the left margin and the description.  The default is <c>medium</c>, which is illustrated above. Conversion to <latex /> ignores the attribute.  An example with <c>narrow</c>:
                <dl width="narrow">
                    <li>
                        <title>Red</title>

                <idx>named list</idx><idx><h>list</h><h>named</h></idx>

                <p>A list can be wrapped with a <tag>list</tag> element, so that it earns a number, can be given a title and have an introduction and conclusion.  Cross-references to individual list items get a bit involved as they are prefixed with the number of the list and then the number of the item, so conceivably you could get a number like <c>4.5.3:2.a.ii</c>.  The colon is used to indicate the transition from the number of the list within divisions and the numbers coming from the list hierarchy, since it has two small dots.</p>

                <list xml:id="list-colors-rainbow">

                    <introduction>
                        <p>Because the colors are always in the same order, an ordered list is natural here.  The colors change continuously, but are often divided up into large ranges that human perception can easily distinguish.</p>

                <p>A list in a paragraph is a construction in HTML that browsers try to correct, which leads to unpredictable results, so we have to decompose an author's paragraph with lists into a sequence of HTML paragraphs, interrupted by lists.  This subsection is only relevant to HTML output, and only for testing.<idx><h>paragraph</h><h>normal</h></idx></p>

                <p><ol>

                <p>This is a list arranged into two columns with some intentional layout challenges. The math is too long to fit in one column and can't be wrapped - it reduces the number of columns in its row. The long text items can be wrapped and stay within their column.

            <p>That was a Sage cell just now, which has nothing to do with tables.  But we needed someplace to test placement right after a division heading.  Carry on.</p>

            <p>A very minimal table, hence with left-justified cells, no borders.  We do wrap the tabular element in a table element to get centering, numbering and a caption.  Footnotes inside cells are tested here.</p>

            <p>Tables can be used and abused many ways.  We describe long division of polynomials by using vertical and horizontal borders on individual entries of a <tag>tabular</tag>.  The division lines are slightly thicker than the subtraction lines.  This is a good example of the typical abuse of tables for horizontal and vertical layout.  At least we have called it a <q>Figure,</q> not a <q>Table</q>.</p>

               <p>This example tests several things.  In <latex /> output, figures, tables, listings and side-by-sides are <q>floats</q> whose placement can migrate, but we have tries to supress this behavior.  However, a float that is the first item of an <q>environment</q> (like a theorem or an example) can still float to a position <em>before</em> its title.  If that does not happen here, then our additional defenses are working.</p>

               <p>This example also checks that the total number of columns is correctly computed from the first row, which features several <c>colspan</c> attributes.</p>

            </table>

            <p>Table cells with a fixed width where text wraps are known as <q>paragraph cells</q>. A cell will be created as a paragraph cell if and only if it has <tag>p</tag> children. And such cells should <em>only</em> have <tag>p</tag> children. The width of a paragraph cell is determined by a <c>width</c> attribute on the corresponding <tag>col</tag> (as a percentage). If the column has a non-paragraph cell with contents that are wider than the paragraph cells, results will be undesirable. There is presently no implementation for a paragraph cell that has a <c>colspan</c> greater than <m>1</m>, although cells with <c>colspan</c> greater than <m>1</m> that are above or below a paragraph cell will behave. Setting <c>width</c> on a <tag>col</tag> that has no paragraph cells may produce unexpected results. A <c>valign</c> for the parent <tag>row</tag> (or the ambient <tag>tabular</tag>) can control vertical alignment (top, middle, or bottom). A paragraph cell's <c>halign</c> attribute (left, center, right, or justify) controls how the text is justfied. Cells inherit <c>halign</c> from <tag>row</tag>, <tag>col</tag>, and <tag>tabular</tag> in that order of preference. In a non-paragraph cell where <c>halign='justify'</c>, the horizontal alignment will match the behavior of <c>halign='left'</c>.</p>

            <p>Table cells can have multiline content using <tag>line</tag> elements. This is not the same thing as a paragraph cell<mdash />line breaking will happen precisely where the author tells it to. A <tag>line</tag> will not break, even on a narrow screen. If a cell uses a <tag>line</tag>, it must only use a sequence of <tag>line</tag>s and no other content. As with paragraph cells, you can use a <c>valign</c> attribute for the row.</p>

            <p>Tables are formed in <latex /> output with copious use of the <c>\multicolumn</c> macro to override more global alignment settings, and to spread the content of one cell across several columns.  However, sometimes <latex />'s special characters have behaved badly in this situation.  So the table below, two items per row, is just designed for <latex /> testing.  But of course, it should still render fine in other formats.  The three test cases are from <xref ref="section-urls" type="text-global"/>, but without 50 alphabetic characters and 8 digits, which should not be problems in this context.  In order to test the use of a percent sign (<c>%</c>) in a URL, we follow it by two hex digits, specifically, <c>58</c>, which is a way to represent the character <c>X</c> in a <init>URL</init>.  The first column's entries are <em>forced</em> to be wrapped in a <c>\multicolumn</c> by specifying their horizontal alignment.  The second column's entries <em>will not</em> be wrapped in a <c>\multicolumn</c>.  So the two columns will look identical, other than the first having a left alignment, and the second has the default center alignment.  (This table is known to render poorly in a Jupyter notebook.  The cause is four dollar signs present in rows 1 and 3, and is explained in <xref ref="subsection-jupyter-dollars" text="type-global"/>.)</p>

            <p>We now finish this section with some <em>long</em> tables.  Ones that will not fit on a single printed page.  So this is only of interest when producing this sample article as a <init>PDF</init>.  First a <q>naked</q> tabular, which should force a new page to start, and then still overrun the end of the page.</p>

            <p>When you wish to allow a <tag>tabular</tag> to split itself at a page break, you can add the attribute <attr>break</attr> with the value <c>yes</c>.  Certainly this will control a <tag>table</tag> or <tag>tabular</tag> which is longer than a page, but will also allow a shorter one to break.  This might useful in a draft stage before undertaking page-fitting.</p>

            <p>Here is the long <tag>tabular</tag> again, but with the <attr>break</attr> attribute set to <c>yes</c>.</p>

            <p>This device is not ideal, as some features of tables are not behaving as expected.  More precisely, we switch from the standard <latex/> <c>tabular</c> environment to the <c>longtable</c> environment from the package of the same name when table-breaking is requested.  So there may be some undesirable interaction with other packages.  For one, full-width horizontal rules seem to become as wide as the page (rather than as wide as the tabular).  The following table is <xref ref="horizontal-rules-table" text="type-global"/> repeated but as a breakable <tag>tabular</tag>.  The <c>longtable</c> package documentation suggests it accomodates the <c>array</c> package, but it also seems to make a variety of redefinitions.  Furthermore, a panel of a side-by-side cannot be a breakable tabular, or a <latex/> compilation error occurs.</p>

                <!-- First paragraph duplicated in next section -->
                <p>When outputting Web page versions, it is possible to embed a variety of dynamic interactive elements.  In a <latex />/PDF version, these will necessarily need to be replaced by some static substitute, such as a screenshot.  See <xref ref="section-sage-cells" text="type-global" /> for the specifics of embedding instances of the Sage Cell Server, which is more elaborate, and not entirely similar.</p>

                <p>Interactives in this section are those for which you provide code you have authored.  Generally, the libraries involved to support this have open licenses, though the player for GeoGebra may be an exception.  Creating these assumes some familiarity with <init>HTML</init> and Javascript.  See <xref ref="section-interactive-server" text="type-global" /> for more interactives that are perhaps simpler to create or use.</p>

                <p>(2018-06-22) Almost everything in this section is under active development and not stable yet.  Feel free to experiment and make suggestions and requests.  This page takes a while to completely load, so be patient.</p>

            <subsection xml:id="interactive-html5-canvas">
                <title>HTML5 Canvas</title>

                <p><init>HTML5</init> introduced the <tag>canvas</tag> element, which can be thought of a blank slate, a place to draw or write on.  So <pretext /> has the <tag>slate</tag> element for a similar purpose.  Generally, but not exclusively, <init>HTML5</init> writes on a <tag>canvas</tag> using the Javascript language.  We demonstrate this approach to interactive diagrams in this subsection.</p>

                <p>The following examples are from David Austin's excellent <url href="http://merganser.math.gvsu.edu/david/linear.algebra/ula/index.html" visual="merganser.math.gvsu.edu/david/linear.algebra/ula/index.html"><pubtitle>Understanding Linear Algebra</pubtitle></url> textbook, which can be found at <cd>

                </cd>David's contribution of examples, and assistance designing the <pretext /> elements is greatly appreciated.  Alright, let's learn some linear algebra.  Yes, there are some learning opportunities in this subsection.</p>

The four entries of the matrix <m>A</m> are coded into the interactive.  Can you deduce <m>A</m> simply by using the interactive?  Which theorem is the key?</p>

You will not see the grey vector until you change the matrix using one of the two sliders on the left.  Why is that?  What are the eigenvectors of the initial matrix?</p>

                <warning>
                    <p>If your <tag>interactive</tag> employs a <tag>slate</tag> with a <attr>surface</attr> attribute whose value is <c>html</c>, then you are advised to augment each top-level (<init>HTML</init>) element within the <tag>slate</tag> with the attribute:<cd>
                        <cline>xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"</cline>
                    </cd>This will identify <em>all</em> of the elements within the <tag>slate</tag> as <init>HTML</init> elements and not as <pretext/> elements.  The danger is that elements with the same name in both languages, such as <tag>li</tag> and <tag>table</tag>, will be mis-identified.  This could be harmless, but could also create chaos, such as disrupting numbering of <pretext/> elements.</p>

                    <p>See the source code of this document for examples:  <xref ref="figure-animation" text="type-global"/> <xref ref="figure-interactive-slopes" text="type-global"/>, <xref ref="figure-piecewise" text="type-global"/>.</p>

                    <p>Note that the <init>HTML</init> that is output can vary slightly from your source in small, harmless ways, such as empty (self-closing) elements being output with both an opening and a closing tag.  Please report any significant discrepancies.  Soon this requirement will be enforced in the code.</p>
                </warning>

                <p>It is also possible to add <tag>script</tag> elements within an interactive that contain properly escaped JS code. These elements will be placed at the end of the document created to hold the interactive content and can interactive with the other elements within the interactive but can not directly interact with the surrounding page.</p>

                <p>Authors are strongly discouraged from trying to incorporate complex code in the form of a <tag>script</tag>, but it can be a useful tool to call more complex code that is linked via <attr>source</attr> on the <tag>interactive</tag>.</p>

                <p>This example uses a <tag>script</tag> to draw <q>Hello World</q> to a <tag>slate</tag> </p>

                <p><term>D3</term> is a Javascript library for <q>Data-Driven Documents</q>, which might greatly enhance some data you wish to display.  In short, it uses the animation capabilities of <init>SVG</init>.  Available examples seem sensitive to the version of the library, so we have examples using different versions.  Use the <attr>version</attr> attribute on <tag>interactive</tag> to specify the version number.  The default is <c>5</c>.</p>

                <p>The first example uses the force layout and collision detection from Version 3.  (The necessary commands are very different in Version 4.)  Pretend you are a working shepherding dog.  Can you separate, and catch, one of the herd?</p>

                </figure>

                <p>Similar, but different, this demonstration of a graph layout uses Version 4 of the library.  Technical notes:<ul>
                    <li>We have changed the size of the nodes, and their number, to fit in a smaller space.</li>
                    <li>The Javascript script uses introspection to size itself, which would be a good general practice.</li>

                    <p>This visualisation uses a D3 force simulation to show the Twitter relationships between the Assembly Members in the Welsh Assembly in terms of the number of times each assembly member has mentioned another assembly member in a tweet.</p>

                    <p>Twitter relationships were mined on 22/03/2017, and are representative of the conversational relationships on that date. Links between AMs represent a conversational relationship: one AM has mentioned the other. Party colour indicates the direction of the mention.</p>

                    <p>Hover over the nodes to fade out non-connected nodes.</p>

                    <p>Rather than using intermediate nodes to create curved links (as in Mike Bostock's block), this adds curves by adding a calculated control point for each edge.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Technical notes:<ul>
                    <li>Once the nodes organize themselves (automatically in the beginning), they cannot be moved.</li>
                    <li>We have adjusted the margins in an attempt to keep names visible on the right side, but without giving up too much space.</li>
                    <li>We have adjust the repelling force, and the collision buffer, to better fit the available space.</li>
                    <li>This example required its own <init>CSS</init>, which we have included as part of the <tag>interactive</tag>.</li>
                    <li>The data collected from the Twitter analysis is contained in a <init>JSON</init> file, <c>mention_network.json</c>, and where the script loads that file, it has a hardcoded path.  So this example is a bit brittle, should that file move.</li>

                <p>Entirely similar to using an HTML5 <c>canvas</c> element (<xref ref="interactive-html5-canvas" />), it is possible to control an <init>SVG</init> element with Javascript.  This example is from Mark McClure.</p>

                <p>Look carefully at the source and rendering of this example as <init>HTML</init>.  The functions to choose from via radio buttons, and the change in <m>x</m>, denoted later as <m>h</m>, are being rendered as mathematics by the Javascript MathJax library.  However, this cannot be accomplished with simply <c>$...$</c> nor by simply <c>\(...\)</c>, but instead by using the <c>\(...\)</c> and then also wrapping that in a <tag>span</tag> element with a <attr>class</attr> attribute set to <c>process-math</c>. (The latter is how we instruct MathJax as to which parts of a page to process, or not).  So to have MathJax render a nice <m>x^2</m> in this context (math inside <init>HTML</init> inside a <tag>slate</tag> inside an <tag>interactive</tag>) would be accomplished with<cd>
                    <cline>&lt;span class="process-math"&gt;x^2&lt;/span&gt;</cline>

                <p><url href="http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/index.html" visual="jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de">JSXGraph</url> is a <q>cross-browser JavaScript library for interactive geometry, function plotting, charting, and data visualization in the web browser.</q>  Now a <tag>slate</tag> will be what JSXGraph calls a <term>board</term>.  Again, you use Javascript to write onto a <tag>slate</tag>, but have some powerful shortcuts available from the JSXGraph library.  For this reason, <pretext /> calls JSXGraph a <q>language</q>, similar in may respects to how Sage is a language, but is really a Python library.  So realize that the syntax for using JSXGraph is that of Javascript.</p>

                <p>Place Javascript inside a file that is specified with the <attr>source</attr> attribute of the <tag>interactive</tag> element.  Then just be certain that <attr>xml:id</attr> of the <tag>interactive</tag> element is passed as the <init>HTML</init> <c>id</c> in an (early) call to JSXGraph's <c>initBoard()</c> method.</p>

                <p>The following example was contributed by Rick Roesler. The <tag>figure</tag> is comprised of four <tag>stack</tag> elements within a <tag>sidebyside</tag>. By varying the time in the top box, the reader can observe the displacement, velocity, and acceleration of a ball thrown upward with an initial velocity of 30 m/s.</p>

                <p>Generally, we load an interactive into an HTML <c>iframe</c> to sandbox (isolate) it from other interactives.  We does this for your own protection.  So, for example, one interactive cannot talk to another.  If two <tag>slate</tag> need to communicate, then they are related, and should be placed into a single <tag>interactive</tag>, allowed to layout themselves, or grouped within a <tag>sidebyside</tag> allowing finer control.

                <idx>JessieCode</idx>

                <p><url href="https://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/docs_jessiecode/" visual="jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/docs_jessiecode/">JessieCode</url> is a scripting language for JSXGraph. It provides the core geometric and graphing features of JSXGraph without accessing the underlying JavaScript. In order to use JessieCode, you simply create the HTML <tag>div</tag> element as you would for any other JSXGraph interactive plot and then provide the JessieCode script, which focuses on the geometric elements.</p>

                <p>Because JessieCode is provided by JSXGraph, the interactive platform is <c>jsxgraph</c>. The <tag>slate</tag>, however, uses <attr>surface</attr> with value <c>jessiecode</c>. The script can be embedded directly in your code. As usual, you would need to remember to escape the special characters. JessieCode uses <c>&lt;</c> and <c>&gt;</c> for inequalities as well as for declaring objects used to style geometric elements, and <c>&amp;&amp;</c> is the boolean AND operator. Alternatively, you can provide the file as a separate resource, providing the URL with a <attr>source</attr> attribute. Attributes defining the JSXBoard at the time it is created should be included as attributes of the <tag>slate</tag>, including <attr>boundingbox</attr>, <attr>axis</attr>, and <attr>grid</attr>.</p>

                <p>For this first example, the JessieCode was included directly in the XML source as the contents of the associated slate.</p>

                <p>Sage, and the Sage Cell Server, support interactive demonstrations, called <term>interacts</term>.<ul>
                    <li>The interactive elements are nearly trivial to construct.</li>
                    <li>An interact is simply a single Python function (acted on by a decorator).</li>
                    <li>You have the full mathematical power of Sage at your disposal, so can do some very powerful computations with high precision (or exactly).</li>
                    <li>The interface is not as polished as what you can achieve with Javascript libraries.</li>
                    <li>Graphics refresh with a round-trip to the server, so are not nearly as fluid as with other tools.</li>
                </ul>  Note that each interact is insulated from the others, unlike our other employment of the Sage Cell Server.</p>

                <p>This example is by Marshall Hampton, taken from the <url href="https://wiki.sagemath.org/interact/calculus" visual="wiki.sagemath.org/interact/calculus">Sage interact wiki</url>, specifically <url href="https://wiki.sagemath.org/interact/calculus#Numerical_integrals_with_the_midpoint_rule" visual="wiki.sagemath.org/interact/calculus#Numerical_integrals_with_the_midpoint_rule">Numerical integrals with the midpoint rule</url>.</p>

                <p>Also notice that when viewed in dark mode, this sample respects the rendering intent. That is due to <attr>dark-mode-enabled</attr> applied to it.</p>

                <title>Geogebra</title>

                <p>To embed a GeoGebra applet as-is from GeoGebra's Classroom Resources site (by material ID), see <xref ref="subsection-geogebra-server" text="type-global"/>. To design your own applet (either from scratch, or modifying something that already exists in one of those three forms) you may use one of Geogebra's <q>Apps</q> to embed the material in your document. (But note, use of the App comes with licensing restrictions.) <pretext /> will handle most of the technical details for you.</p>

                <p>Do one of the following:<ol>
                    <li>Identify a material ID from GeoGebra's Classroom Resources site. You might even make the material yourself on that site.</li>
                    <li>Obtain a <c>.ggb</c> file from GeoGebra. You might construct something on a desktop installation of GeoGebra and save it. If you have a base64-encoded string for a GeoGebra applet, but you don't have a <c>.ggb</c> file, you can decode the string and save the result. For example, at <url href="https://www.opinionatedgeek.com/codecs/base64decoder"/>.</li>
                    <li>Obtain a base64 encoded string for a GeoGebra applet. You might first open a <c>.ggb</c> file in a desktop installation of GeoGebra, and push ctrl-shift-B (command-shift-B on a Mac) and then the string will be in your clipboard.</li>
                    <li>None of the above, with the intention to make an applet from scratch.</li>
                </ol></p>

                <p>Then mimic the examples that follow, using GeoGebra API commands documented at <url href="https://wiki.geogebra.org/en/Reference:GeoGebra_Apps_API">Geogebra API Manual</url>, but do not include the <c>ggbApplet.</c> or <c>applet.</c> used in examples to prefix the functions<mdash/>that part of the code will be provided automatically by <pretext/>.</p>

                <p>Jack Green created an applet on the Classroom Resources site with ID <c>D4s2v4ft</c>, which you may view at <url href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/D4s2v4ft" visual="www.geogebra.org/m/D4s2v4ft"/>. Suppose you would like to use this in your project, but change something about it. We will change something trivial, making the <m>y</m>-axis ticks be separated <m>5</m> apart instead of <m>10</m> apart. We also decide we want a different aspect ratio and overall width. One gotcha: the original applet is loaded and then <pretext/> uses <attr>width</attr> and <attr>aspect</attr> attributes to resize the viewing window using the top left corner as an anchor. This does not rescale axes and that may leave you with important elements missing from the viewing window. So here we reset the viewing window to return to values that are in the original. Lastly, we disable zooming, which is not helpful for this applet. To do each of these things, we rely on the GeoGebra API manual at <url href="https://wiki.geogebra.org/en/Reference:GeoGebra_Apps_API" visual="wiki.geogebra.org/en/Reference:GeoGebra_Apps_API">Geogebra API Manual</url>. It is important to use one command per line.</p>

                <p>The same can be done with a <c>.ggb</c> file. Here we use two provided by David Rosoff, and one provided by Tevian Dray. The path to the file needs to be relative. First, David's original.</p>

                <p>In this one provided by Tevian Dray, we make no modifications (except for those imposed by the scaling). You will need to zoom out a bit, and then pan over some, to see all the pieces.</p>

                <p>You could also use a base64-encoded string of the <c>.ggb</c> file. You might come across such a string somewhere, or you might generate one by opening a <c>.ggb</c> file in a desktop installation of GeoGebra, and pushing ctrl-shift-B (command-shift-B on a Mac) to get the string in your clipboard. If you do this, you could use a <attr>base64</attr> attribute in place of the <attr>source</attr> attribute in the previous example. We don't do that here because such a string is generally over 5000 characters long and we are keeping the sample article source a bit cleaner.</p>

                <p>The next example shows how you can communicate between a GeoGebra applet and a <tag>slate</tag> contained in the interactive.  The process is mediated by javascript code specified in the <attr>source</attr> attribute of the interactive.  Event listeners in the code update the HTML when the diagram changes or vice-versa.  MathJax is also notified when it needs to update math. </p>

                <p>Note that this example has a <tag>slate</tag> whose <attr>surface</attr> is <c>pretext</c> <em>and</em> a <tag>slate</tag> whose <attr>surface</attr> is <c>html</c>, the latter requiring a namespace declaration.  The former produces HTML according to the <pretext/> templates, which is fairly predictable, but never guaranteed to always be identical over time.  A <pretext/> slate uses familiar syntax, produces results styled consistently, but might break in the future.  While an HTML slate is similar, the results will not be styled, but it does allow for a wider range of HTML elements (a <c>button</c> element here) and will not change over time.</p>

                <p>The indefinite integral in the last row of the table is a gratuitious test that aurhors' macros from <tag>docinfo</tag> are available to MathJax.  Finally, a <pretext/> slate will only recognize <tag>p</tag>, <tag>tabular</tag>, <tag>sidebyside</tag>, and <tag>sbsgroup</tag> as children.  Make a feature request if you have a good case for more.</p>

Note that for accessibilty reasons, some objects are rendered unselectable with the <c>setFixed</c> command. Perhaps this should have been done with the previous examples, but that is more difficult when you do not know all of their names. Note that the GeoGebra scripting command <c>setAttribute</c> also changes the webpage's focus, so it is better to set the perspective using an attribute of the slate.</p>

                <p>An <c>iframe</c> is an <init>HTML</init> element that allows embedding of a complete web page within another one.  Here we use this device to provide interactive 3D diagrams built with other tools.</p>

                <p>We begin with a Jupyter notebook hosted on <url href="https://cocalc.com" visual="CoCalc.com"/>.  News of success on other hosts for Jupyter notebook servers will allow us to expand this description.  We use a Sage kernel and create a 3D surface suggested by Juan Carlos Bustamante:<cd>
                    <cline>var('x,y')</cline>
                    <cline>plot3d(x^2 - y^2, (x,-1,1), (y,-1,1), color="orange", mesh=true)</cline>
                </cd>
                News of other computational engines that produce similar graphics will also allow us to further expand this description.  Note that for the case of Sage 3D plots, support for the <tag>sageplot</tag> element makes this even easier.  For example, see <xref ref="figure-sage-implicit-surface"/>.</p>

                <p>A button in the lower right allows for several options, one is <c>Save as HTML</c>, which will produce a complete self-contained web page we can recycle.  We save this file with our other externally-created images, in a directory that we choose to name <c>iframe</c><mdash/>you can use another name.  Then we make an <tag>interactive</tag> with an <attr>iframe</attr> attribute that has the filename, starting from <c>iframe/</c> (in other words, do not include the name of your managed directory of external images).</p>

                <p>Note that the downloaded file has links to specific versions of the <c>three.js</c> library, which are beyond our control, and beyond your control.  So there is a future where these images may need updating.  You could put your source code into a (large) comment with your project's source for safe-keeping in the future.  See <xref ref="interactive-iframes-server" text="type-global"/> for the server version.</p>

            <subsection xml:id="interactive-threejs">
                <title>threejs</title>

                <p>Once upon a time there was an example here using the <c>threejs</c> 3D Javascript library.  It was <url href="https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_geometry_extrude_splines" visual="threejs.org/examples/#webgl_geometry_extrude_splines">one of the project's examples</url>, licensed with an MIT License, with minimal modifications.</p>

                <p>But it would seem to have become a bit more complicated to embed and our example was not rendering.  As of 2022-08-08, we have removed it.  Of course, you can find it in the git repository, perhaps searching on the date string just mentioned.  It woulld be interesting to see if our <tag>interactive</tag> framework could still support the changes.</p>

                <p>The following two examples are meant to be instructive (<em>only</em>).  The end result is accomplished in a much more straightforward way be the method in <xref ref="interactive-iframes-local" text="type-global"/>.  We illustrate a way to get a <c>three.js</c> image out of an <init>HTML</init> page as a Javascript file and render it on a <pretext/> <tag>slate</tag>.  We follow the second method in a <url href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2017/12/sagemath_and_3d_models_in_webp.html" visual="golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2017/12/sagemath_and_3d_models_in_webp.html">blog post from the <m>n</m>-Category Cafe</url>.<ol>
                    <li>Open a Jupyter Notebook that utilizes a Sage kernel.  This can be done easily at <url href="https://cocalc.com" visual="cocalc.com">CoCalc</url> (and for free initially).</li>

                    <li>Sketch a surface using Sage code.  We recycle the suggestion from Juan Carlos Bustamante in <xref ref="interactive-iframes-local" text="type-global"/>:<cd>
                        <cline>var('x,y')</cline>
                        <cline>plot3d(x^2 - y^2, (x,-1,1), (y,-1,1), color="orange", mesh=true)</cline>
                    </cd></li>

                    <li>Look for a button (in the lower-right) which will provide a menu option <c>Save as HTML</c>.  Save the resulting <init>HTML</init> file, and open a <em>copy</em> in a text editor.</li>

                    <li>
                        <p>You are now looking for two <init>HTML</init> <c>script</c> elements.  One will tell you just which version of <c>three.js</c> is being used, vis a <c>@src</c> attribute.  For the second example below we located<cd>
                            <cline>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sagemath/threejs-sage@r122/build/three.min.js</cline>
                        </cd>The <c>@r122</c> will likely be a version number, which is a good thing for the longevity of your work.  This will get used in the <attr>source</attr> attribute of your <tag>interactive</tag>, which will have <attr>platform</attr> set to <c>javascript</c>.</p>

                        <p>The second <c>script</c> element is likely huge and has many generic functions defined it.  There may be a huge variable full of data points computed by Sage.  Copy the <em>contents</em> of this <c>script</c> element into a new Javascript file (so use a <c>.js</c> extension).  Do not edit in any way until you read further.  Once adjusted, this file too gets specified in the <attr>source</attr> attribute of your <tag>interactive</tag>.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>Your <tag>interactive</tag> needs a <tag>slate</tag> element for the graphic to draw on, and you will need to give it a proper <attr>xml:id</attr> attribute, plus teh <attr>surface</attr> will be set to <c>div</c>.  Then you need to edit the Javascript file to connect the graphic with the slate, via IDs in your <pretext/> source and on teh <init>HTML</init> <c>div</c> created by the slate.  Look at the provided examples to see how.  Do not make any other edits to this file, even if tempted.</li>

                    <li>Study the two examples below, and mimic how they were constructed.</li>
                </ol></p>

                <p>First, the example given in the blog post referenced above.</p>

            <subsection xml:id="interactive-doenetml">
                <title>DoenetML</title>

                <p>
                    <url href="https://doenet.org">DoenetML</url> is a markup language
                    inspired by <pretext/> for semantically describing interactive
                    mathematics applets for the web. Use
                    <c>interactive[@platform="doenetml"]</c> with a
                    <c>slate[@surface="doenetml"]</c> to include DoenetML content
                    within your document.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since DoenetML is similar to,
                    but not completely compatible with, XML, it cannot be authored
                    directly within a PreTeXt document without painstakingly escaping
                    every <c>&lt;</c> as <c>&amp;lt;</c> and every <c>&amp;</c>
                    as <c>&amp;amp;</c>. However, a convenient workflow to avoid this
                    is to author your DoenetML in a separate file like
                    <c>example.doenetml</c>, then include this file
                    within your <pretext/> document using
                    <c>&lt;xi:include parse="text" href="path/to/example.doenetml"/&gt;</c>.

            <introduction>
                <!-- First paragraph duplicated in previous section -->
                <p>When outputting Web page versions, it is possible to embed a variety of dynamic interactive elements.  In a <latex />/PDF version, these will necessarily need to be replaced by some static substitute, such as a screenshot.  See <xref ref="section-sage-cells" text="type-global" /> for the specifics of embedding instances of the Sage Cell Server, which is more elaborate, and not entirely similar.</p>

                <p>Interactives in this section have code that lives on a server somewhere (in the <q>cloud</q>).  So maybe you uploaded an interactive demonstration, or maybe somebody else did.  In this sense, these are easier to create or use.  But pay attention, the code may come with restrictive licenses, even if you are the author originally.  See <xref ref="section-interactive-authored" text="type-global" /> for more interactives that can be free as in <q>freedom</q> or <foreign xml:lang="fr-FR">liberté</foreign>.  CalcPlot3D is the notable exception here.</p>

                <p>(2018-06-22) Almost everything in this section is under active development and not stable yet.  Feel free to experiment and make suggestions and requests.  This page takes a while to completely load, so be patient.</p>
            </introduction>

            <subsection xml:id="subsection-geogebra-server">
                <title>GeoGebra</title>
                <idx><h>Geogebra</h><h>server</h></idx>
                <idx><h>Geogebra</h><h>material</h></idx>

                <p>A Geogebra <term>material</term> is something you might use in a class.  It could also be called an interactive demonstration.  Go browsing at <url href="https://www.geogebra.org/materials/" visual="www.geogebra.org/materials/"/> and find something appropriate for your project.  Or make an account and create your own.</p>

                <p>Once you find a material that looks instructive, it will be at a <init>URL</init> such as<cd>https://www.geogebra.org/m/KGn2d4Qd</cd> and you want to pick off the identifier on the end, in this case <c>KGn2d4Qd</c>.  Then author<cd>&lt;interactive geogebra="KGn2d4Qd" /&gt;</cd>  At this writing (2018-02-04) you will want to place this inside a <c>figure</c>, with a caption, as we do right now with material <c>KGn2d4Qd</c>.</p>

                <p>The shape of the material will be fixed, so guess (or measure with an on-screen ruler), the aspect ratio and use that in the <tag>interactive</tag> element. If the width of the original material is anything other than 800 pixels, you should add <attr>material-width</attr> with the actual material width (units are pixels).</p>

                <figure>
                    <caption>Right Triangle Paradox</caption>
                    <interactive xml:id="geogebra-right-triangle" geogebra="KGn2d4Qd" width="70%" aspect="9:5" reset-icon="yes"/>
                </figure>

                <p>There are some optional control elements that Geogebra provides, such as the presence of the toolbar and the reset button. These can be controlled by adding the following additional attributes to the <c>interactive</c>.
                <ul>
                    <li><p><c>toolbar="yes"</c>: add the Geogebra toolbar above the material</p></li>
                    <li><p><c>algebra-input="yes"</c>: add an entry box below the material to add graphical objects using algebra formulas or Geogebra graphical commands</p></li>
                    <li><p><c>reset-icon="yes"</c>: enable the reset icon</p></li>
                    <li><p><c>shift-drag-zoom="yes"</c>: enable ability to drag and zoom the viewing context</p></li>

                <title>Desmos Graphs</title>
                <idx>Desmos graphs</idx>

                <p><term>Desmos</term> provides interactive graphing applications.  The following example was created by Ann Cary and made available via the <q>Share</q> function of Desmos.  You can make your own Desmos graph, choose the <q>Share</q> icon, and the <q>Embed</q> option, to get a <init>URL</init> such as <cd>https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ttox1bvxku</cd>  You want to pick off the identifier on the end, in this case <c>ttox1bvxku</c>, then author<cd>&lt;interactive desmos="ttox1bvxku" width="60%" aspect="2:3" /&gt;</cd> as we have done here.</p>

                <p>The static image employed in the <latex /> version of this article was obtained by viewing the graph at the Desmos site (<ie />, not the embedded version in the <pretext /> HTML version), and using the Share button to export a <init>PNG</init> image.  In this case, we used a <q>Medium Rectangle</q> and <q>Thick</q> lines.</p>

                <title>CalcPlot3D</title>
                <idx>CalcPlot3D</idx>

                <p>CalcPlot3D is a Javascript application for creating, visualizing, and understanding plots of 3D surfaces.  So it would be an ideal companion to a book on multivariate calculus, but should be useful in other courses of study.</p>

                <p>To use it, start at the <url href="https://c3d.libretexts.org/CalcPlot3D/index.html" visual="c3d.libretexts.org/CalcPlot3D/index.html">online app version</url>.  Create a plot and adjust the image to a viewpoint and scale if you like.  Then, click the menu/hamburger icon in the upper-left and choose <c>File</c>.  From here you can save a <init>PNG</init> image for the static version, but you also want to select <c>Encode View in URL</c>.  Now your browser address bar is filled with a query string (<em>all</em> the stuff <em>after</em> the question-mark) that has all the information necessary to reproduce your plot (and view).  Copy everything after the first question-mark to the <c>interactive/code</c> element.  Be sure to replace any ampersands by <c>&amp;amp;</c> (see the Author's Guide for more about certain characters in <init>URL</init>s).  Examine the source for the examples below to see how they are authored.  The <pubtitle>Help Manual</pubtitle> for CalcPlot3D is also available off the menu/hamburger icon in the upper-left.</p>

                <p>In <xref ref="figure-intersecting-planes" text="type-global"/> grab the image with your mouse and rotate it in various directions.  Then while the image has focus, press the <c>3</c> key (short for <q>3-D</q>), to get a 3D view, which will require some red-blue 3D glasses to fully appreciate.  Press the key again to return to a regular view.</p>

                <p>When using a version with controls (e.g. <xref ref="figure-wavefunction" text="type-global"/>), or the full application (e.g. <xref ref="figure-calcplot3d" text="type-global"/>), specify an aspect ratio that is wider than it is tall.  Start with <c>aspect="3:2"</c>, and perhaps fine-tune from there.</p>

                        <p>The Sieve of Eratosthenes computes prime numbers by starting with a finite list of the integers bigger than 1.  The first member of the list is a prime and is saved/recorded.  Then all multiples of that prime (which not a prime, excepting the prime itself!) are removed from the list.  Now the first number remaining in the list is the next prime number.  And the process repeats.</p>

                <p>This section demonstrates the use of dynamic randomized exercises built upon the framework of Runestone components. These demonstration problems incorporate a library supporting mathematical expressions both for varying the content of the statement of the exercises as well as the checking of submitted answers.</p>

                    <solution>
                        <p>
                            Knowing the roots of a polynomial allows us to write down the formula of <m>f(x)</m> in factored form,
                            <me>f(x) = A <eval obj="base_cubic"/></me>
                            with an unknown scaling multiple <m>A</m>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When we evaluate <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=0</m> using this formula, we find
                            <me>f(0) = <eval obj="base_yint"/>A</me>.
                            Since we also know <m>f(0)=<eval obj="y0"/></m>, we can write down the equation
                            <me>A <eval obj="base_cubic"/> = <eval obj="y0"/></me>
                            and find that <m>A=<eval obj="A"/></m>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Consequently, we can write our function in the form

                        Noticing that the expression <m><eval obj="innerFormula"/></m> appears inside parentheses with a power,
                        it makes sense to think of that as the inner function, defining <m>g(x) = <eval obj="innerFormula"/></m>.
                        The outer function describes what happens to that.
                        If we imagined replacing the formula <m><eval obj="innerFormula"/></m> with a box and then call that box our variable <m>x</m>, we find the outer function is given by <m>f(x) = <eval obj="outerFormula"/></m>.

But use an <tag>audio</tag> element and have the <attr>source</attr> attribute point to an OGG, MP3, or WAV file.  Plus, an <attr>aspect</attr> attribute will be ignored.</p>

            <p>We have not entirely decided how to handle the static version present in a PDF.</p>

            <p>First in a <tag>figure</tag>, so it can be cross-referenced.</p>

            <introduction>
                <p>First, a gratuitous reference to Exercise<nbsp /><xref ref="exercises-cosine-derivative" /> about the derivative of a cosine.</p>

                <p>You can specify a video by a filename if you host it as part of your document, or a <init>URL</init> giving a location on the Internet.  There are a few extra features for YouTube and Vimeo videos, which are near the bottom of this page, so look there first if that meets your needs.</p>
            </introduction>

            <subsection>
                <title>Video Files</title>

                <p>Embedded videos can make sense for a web version of your document. This is a video promoting the University of Puget Sound to potential new students, in WebM format.  Support is limited to HTML5-capable browsers.  The file format can be MP4, Ogg, or WebM, though this may vary depending upon the browser.  Use a <tag>video</tag> element, within either a <tag>figure</tag> (numbered, captioned) or a <tag>sidebyside</tag> for more precise control.   The <attr>source</attr> attribute in this first example <em>does not</em> include an extension, and so three possibilities above will be searched for preferentially (you need only provide the video in one format, but providing additional versions will increase the chances every browser will find a compatible format).</p>

                <figure>
                    <caption>University of Puget Sound Promotional Video</caption>
                    <video label="ups-promo-frame-one" source="video/ups-visitor-guide-360" width="80%" preview="preview/ups-promo-frame-one.jpg" />
                </figure>

                <p>You can replace the <q>preview</q> image of a video with one of your own making.  <init>HTML</init> refers to this as the <term>poster</term>, presumably because it advertises the video.  The image you make should be of the same quality as the video, and with the same aspect-ratio, and is presumably one of the frames of the video.  So a screenshot is the likely avenue.  (Maybe we will have advice on how to do this easily, or see <url href="https://github.com/PreTeXtBook/pretext/issues/853" visual="github.com/PreTeXtBook/pretext/issues/853">Issue #853</url>.)

                <idx><h>reference</h><h>external, url</h></idx>
                On the <tag>video</tag> tag, include a <attr>preview</attr> attribute which is the name of an image file, including a relative path.  (JPEG or PNG formats are best.  JPEG may be smaller for video screenshots, while PNG is lossless and so may work better for diagrams.)  The next video has a preview/poster that is a fram part way into the introduction.</p>

                <figure>
                    <caption>University of Puget Sound Promotional Video</caption>
                    <video label="ups-promo-preview" source="video/ups-visitor-guide-360" width="80%" preview="preview/ups-promo-preview.jpg" />
                </figure>

                <p>If you find the posters provided automatically for a video to be distracting or objectionable, you can cover them up by requesting a generic poster with the attribute-value pair: <c>preview = "generic"</c>.</p>

                <figure>
                    <caption>University of Puget Sound Promotional Video</caption>
                    <video label="ups-promo-generic" source="video/ups-visitor-guide-360" width="80%" preview="generic" />
                </figure>

                <p>You can use a very similar construction to point to a video hosted somewhere on the Internet, just use a complete <init>URL</init> for the <tag>source</tag> attribute.  Note that if the URL has a query string (parameters following a question-mark), then any ampersands (&amp;) will need to be escaped, so as to not confuse the <init>XML</init> processor (<ie /> use <c>&amp;amp</c>).  Also, the question-mark character needs to <em>not</em> be <init>URL</init>-encoded (<c>%3F</c>), so presumably edit the <init>URL</init> to be the character.  Here are several examples, the second one uses the <attr>start</attr> and <attr>stop</attr> attributes to limit the video to just the time between the 16-second and 30-second locations, and has asymmetric margins.</p>

                <p>Videos are assumed to have a 16:9 aspect ratio (width:height).  If this is not the case, then you must specify the aspect ratio with either a ratio (e.g. 4:3) or as a number expressing the fraction width/height (e.g. 1.3333).  Four decimal places should suffice for the latter.  Note that you cannot <em>change</em> the aspect ratio, and you <em>must</em> supply the aspect ratio for any video that does not have the default ratio.  This is a technical requirement that allows us to smoothly scale the videos on small devices (try this page on your mobile phone!).</p>

                <p>YouTube<idx><h>YouTube videos</h></idx><idx><h>videos</h><h>YouTube</h></idx> videos may be embedded with only knowledge of a video's <q>ID</q> or a <q>playlist ID</q>.  A single video's YouTube ID is a string of eleven seemingly random characters that show up in the URL when you watch a video.  For the Led Zeppelin performance below, the ID is <c>hAzdgU_kpGo</c>, which you might normally watch directly from the URL <url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAzdgU_kpGo"  visual="www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAzdgU_kpGo" />.  As described just above, you need to specify a different aspect ratio if the video does not have a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>

                <p>Note: some of these videos may not play if viewed locally, and maybe not even if you start up a local web server (such as can be easily done with Python).  So if you are testing new features, be careful about assuming videos from cloud services are not working properly.</p>

                <p>If you have ever owned a drone, you sympathize with this guy.  Way funnier than a cat video.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>If you are only interested in a piece of the action, you can limit the video with <c>start</c> and <c>end</c> attributes in seconds.  You might make those times clear in the caption for readers getting the link out of a PDF.  Some videos may not respect these parameters.</p>

                <p>Videos were first designed mostly on the assumption that they are wrapped in a <c>figure</c> with a <c>title</c> (which is distinct from a <c>caption</c>).  But you can just place a video <q>naked</q> inbetween a couple of paragraphs.  This is nice if you don't want the clutter of numbers, and/or if you plan to exclude videos from some edition of your document.</p>

                <p>We can pack two videos side-by-side, with a lot of horizontal control, using two panels in the <c>sidebyside</c> element.  We have simply chosen here to not provide a caption (overall, or separately) as an illustration.  The sizes are purposely a bit odd.  See <xref ref="section-side-by-side" text="type-global"/> for much more on side-by-side panels.  These videos come from the <q>Topic</q> and <q>VEVO</q> areas of YouTube (respectively) and both have start/end times.</p>

                <title>Vimeo</title>

                <p>We support videos from <url href="https://vimeo.com/" visual="vimeo.com">Vimeo</url> in much the same way as YouTube videos.  Now the identifier is a long integer.  For example, the video up next would normally be found at <c>https://vimeo.com/27246366</c>.  But instead, you can embed the video with as little as <c>&lt;video vimeo="27246366"/&gt;</c>.  As of 2019-05-18, we intend to support as many of the options described above as possible.  Widths and heights (via the aspect ratio) will perform as expected.  We have not investigated start and end times.</p>

                <title>Captions and Subtitles</title>

                <p>Experimental support for captions and subtitles first.  Look at the source, which mimics the actual HTML.  The words of the titles and/or subcaptions (there is a difference!) come from a file in <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebVTT" visual="wikipedia.org/wiki/WebVTT">Web Video Text Tracks</url> (<init>WEBVVT</init>) format.</p>

                <p>This video is identical to the previous one, except it tests the use of a default <tag>track</tag>.  The <attr>default</attr> attribute on <tag>track</tag> can be set to the value <c>yes</c> to make one set of captions the default (and only one!).  Test is a bit lame, the two <tag>track</tag> use the same file, but just have different labels for the player's menu.  Track named <c>US English Two</c> will show as in-use at start-up.</p>

        Various author tools are planned.  Note the embedded "todo"
        elements above.  An XSL transform in-testing will extract them
        for a report, and they are hidden in actual output.
        For a cross-reference, instead of a "ref" atrribute,
        you can use a "provisional" attribute while writing, which is
        especially useful for unknown forward references.  This is
        included in the author report also.
        A "preview" XSL transform to HTML could be especially useful.

        <section xml:id="section-cross-referencing" label="section-cross-referencing">
            <title>Cross-Referencing</title>

            <p>Cross-references<idx>cross-reference</idx> are easy, since that is a key reason for having a highly structured document.  Here is a useful feature if you elect to use it.  Any <tag>xref</tag> will <q>know</q> what it points to, so you can let it provide the <q>naming</q> part of the cross-reference text.  You can turn this on globally with the command-line parameter <c>autoname</c><idx><h>autoname</h></idx> set to <c>'yes'</c>.  If you do that, you will see most of the names in this document doubled, since the names are written into the source already in most places outside of this section.</p>

            <p>Moreover, the names themselves will change with the use of the one language dependent file.  And another bonus is that with an autoname, you automatically get a <em>non-breaking</em> space between the name and the reference.  The autoname switch makes no sense for <q>provisional</q> cross-references, since there is no information about what they point to.</p>

            <p>Here is a reference that has no indication of its type in the source:  <xref ref="theorem-FTC" />.  So by default you will just see a number that you can click on.  If you use the <c>text="type-global"</c> switch then you should see <q>Theorem</q> prepended.  Note that if you changed the theorem to a lemma, then that change would be reflected here automatically when autonaming is in effect.</p>

            <p>If you set the autonaming behavior globally, or accept the default behavior, there will still be instances where you want to override that choice.  Simple: just say <c>text="type-global"</c> or <c>text="global"</c> as part of the <c>xref</c>.  Each example below should look the same each time this article is processed, no matter how the global <c>autoname</c> is set.<ul>
                <li><p>No name ever: <xref ref="corollary-FTC-derivative" text="global" /></p></li>
                <li><p>Always named: <xref ref="corollary-FTC-derivative" text="type-global" /></p></li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>You might also wish to provide a prefix to a cross-reference and have it incorporated into the text of what you would click on in an electronic version.  So if you make an <c>xref</c> with some content, then that content will prefix the cross-reference within the clickable/pokeable text and be attached with a non-breaking space.  This <c>xref</c> content totally overrides any prefix that might happen otherwise.  So the name of an item (<eg /> <q>corollary</q>) could be replaced, and if you make a cross-reference with custom text, that will be the clickable also.  An example:<ul>
                <li><p>A grand result: <xref ref="corollary-FTC-derivative">Major Corollary</xref></p></li>
                <li><p>A grand result: <xref ref="corollary-FTC-derivative" text="custom">a nice corollary</xref></p></li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>Suppose you want to reference two theorems, so you might want to say something like <q>Theorems 4.6 and 5.2.</q>  With global autonaming on, you can override the first <c>Theorem</c> by providing the content <c>Theorems</c> on the first <c>xref</c> and <c>text="global"</c> on the second <c>xref</c>.  (With global autonaming off, you will also get what you want/expect.)   Here is the test, which should look correct no matter what the global switch is:  <xref ref="section-cross-referencing">Sections</xref> and <xref ref="section-internationalization" text="global" />.  (But notice that it is up to you to be certain the types of these targets do not change without you changing the content of the first <c>xref</c>.  The <q>author-tools</q> mode and careful choices of <c>xml:id</c> strings can help avoid this trap.)</p>

            <p>If you set the value of <attr>text</attr> to <c>title</c>, then the title you assigned to the theorem will be used as the link for a cross-reference.  Here is a the final example, which refers to a fundamental theorem by name <xref ref="theorem-FTC" text="title" />.</p>

            <p>Cross-references to exercises with hard-coded numbers should respect the supplied number.  Exercise<nbsp /><xref ref="exercise-with-hardcoded-number" /> should reference problem 42a.</p>

            <p>Here we form a list to test pointing at various structures.  Each of the following should open a knowl in the HTML version, otherwise it will be a traditional hyperlink (if possible).  Note that if a knowl opens, there will always be an <q>in-context</q> link which will take you to the actual location, should you have  wished instead to just go there.<ul>

            <p>Cross-references to structural elements of the document will always take you there directly, since even in the HTML version these parts never get realized as knowls.  You will find such links sprinkled through this document, but here is an autonamed link to a subsubsection:  <xref ref="subsubsection-different-integrals" text="type-global" />.</p>

            <p>Cross-references can be built into display mathematics, but they can only point to one item (<ie /> a comma-delimited list of targets is not supported).  Examples below should test the distinction in HTML output between a link that opens a knowl and a link that jumps to a larger chunk of content.  Notice that display mathematics is entirely <latex /> syntax, no matter which output format you create.  So if you do not use the <c>autoname</c> facility, you need to wrap non-math text in <c>\text{}</c> and perhaps use a tilde (<c>~</c>) as a non-breaking space (examine the source of this article).</p>

            <p><md>
                <mrow>x^2 + y^2 &amp;= z^2&amp;&amp;<xref ref="theorem-FTC" text="type-global" /></mrow>
                <mrow>a^2 + b^2 &amp;= c^2&amp;&amp;\text{Section}~<xref ref="section-fundamental-theorem" /></mrow>
            </md><idx><h>bug</h><h>in-context broken</h></idx></p>

            <p>Variations on the above include multiple <c>xml:id</c> as the value of a single <c>ref</c> attribute on an <c>xref</c>, in the form of a comma-separated list.  In this case, only the numbers are links/knowls and the autonaming attribute is based on the type of the first <c>ref</c>.  Wrapping with brackets (citations) or parentheses (equations) is also controlled by the type of the first <c>ref</c>.  And the <c>detail</c> attribute for a bibliographic reference is silently ignored.  So you can do silly things like have a reference to a theorem within a list of equation numbers and there will be no error message.  Handle with care.  Spaces after commas in the list will migrate to the output as spaces, so if you don't have any, you won't get any.<ul>
                <!-- NB: a knowl for "theorem-number-02" will *only* be created if this list is decomposed -->
                <!-- properly, so do not remove, and certainly do not cross-reference it elsewhere         -->
                <li><p>Four theorems, with spaces, autonamed: <xref ref="theorem-FTC, theorem-number-01, theorem-number-02, theorem-number-03" text="type-global"/></p></li>
                <li><p>Two equations, no spaces, autonamed: <xref ref="equation-alternate-FTC,equation-use-FTC" text="type-global"/></p></li>
                <li><p>Two bibliographic items, no autoname: <xref ref="biblio-judson-AATA, biblio-lay-article" /></p></li>
                <!-- <li><p>: <xref ref="" /></p></li> -->
            </ul></p>

            <p>If you have a long list of items (such as homework exercises, not in an <c>exercisegroup</c>, or perhaps several chapters), you can get a cross-reference that prints as a range by using <c>xref</c> with two attributes <c>first</c> and <c>last</c>, which may contain a single <c>xml:id</c> each.  As with multiple references, <c>first</c> will control autonaming and other features.<ul>
                <li><p>A range of exercises, autonamed (this range appears <q>out-of-order</q> since the two <c>exercise</c> are numbered under two different schemes): <xref first="exercise-essay" last="exercise-test-number" text="type-global"/></p></li>

            <p>The <c>url</c><idx>url</idx> element may be used to link to a data file, either externally, or internally, if you want to make such an object available to a reader.<idx><h>reference</h><h>external</h></idx>  A good example use case is a spreadsheet that might be part of an exercise, or contain data relevant to some discussion.  First let us suppose the data resides somewhere on the Internet, then just use the complete address.  Here is one from Microsoft: <url href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=521962" visual="go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=521962">Sample Excel Spreadsheet</url>.</p>

            <p>You can also provide a file yourself, but now it is your obligation to distribute the file with your document (<init>HTML</init>, <init>PDF</init>, <etc />) and provide a relative link.  This creates some complications, such as making sure an electronic PDF has the associated file in the same place relative to the PDF file.  Of course, if you make a print PDF, this becomes impossible.  Here is a test example anyway, which is highly likely to be broken in a PDF (including at the <pretext /> project site) unless you build this example on your own computer, locally.

            <p>Supporting a multitude of possible characters, across many languages and across many output formats can be a challenge.  One of our goals is to make this much easier for authors.  Fortunately, the Unicode standard has led to improvements from the 7-bit ASCII standard of old.</p>

                <title>Unicode Characters for HTML Output</title>

                <p>First, we discuss HTML output.  If you include Unicode<idx>Unicode</idx> characters in your <pretext /> source, they should survive just fine <foreign xml:lang="fr-FR">en route</foreign> to a web browser or e-reader.  Here are the caveats for HTML output:<ul>
                    <li><p>So that you can continue to get the best results with print and PDF output, use available empty elements for obscure characters, even if targeting HTML output, before resorting to a Unicode character.  For example, use <tage>copyright</tage> for the copyright symbol in text before resorting to the Unicode character <c>U+00A9</c>.  It is a bit more work, but you will get better results with other conversions, even if you initially are only fascinated by <init>HTML</init>.</p></li>

                    <li><p>How you actually enter Unicode characters into your source file is dependent on your editor and operating system, and is therefore outside the scope of our documentation.  You can cut-and-paste characters and text from the source of our examples for initial testing and experimentation.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Always, always identify your source as having Unicode characters by including the incantation
                        <cd>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt;</cd>
                    as the first line of your source file. (You <em>may</em> be able to accurately cut-and-paste this version here.  But if the copy has non-standard characters in it, go back to the top of this source file for a copy.)</p></li>

                    <li><p>Alan Wood’s <url href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/unicode_samples.html" visual="www.alanwood.net/unicode/unicode_samples.html">Unicode Resources</url> has a plethora of samples of various groups of Unicode characters.  If you, or your readers, are <q>missing</q> characters in a web browser, this is a good place to start testing the local setup.</p></li>

                <title>Characters in <latex/>, PDF, print</title>

                <p>The situation for <latex/> is a bit more complicated, since <tex/> pre-dates Unicode's widespread adoption.</p>

                <p>This sample article is intended to work well, out-of-the-box, for authors just starting with <pretext/>.  So we only include here examples that we know are likely to convert to <init>PDF</init> without any errors.  For more extensive examples and experiments, we provide the sample document <c>examples/fonts/fonts-and-characters.xml</c>, so be aware of that example as you look to see what is possible.</p>

                <p>Similarly, you should be able to process this sample article successfully with various <latex/> engines.  We test regularly with <c>pdflatex</c> and <c>xelatex</c> and provide online sample PDF output of this document processed by <c>pdflatex</c>.  In principle, you should be able to use <c>latex</c> (to produce a DVI), and possibly other (unsupported) engines, such as <c>lualatex</c>.</p>

                <p>Once you get beyond the Latin alphabet, with accents common in Western Europe and the Western Hemisphere, you will almost assuredly need to restrict your attention to producing <init>PDF</init> output with the <c>xelatex</c> engine.  This is discussed and tested in <c>examples/fonts/fonts-and-characters.xml</c>.</p>

                <title>Basic Latin, <c>U+0000</c><ndash /><c>U+007F</c></title>

                <p>Unicode uses multiple 8-bit bytes to represent characters, and these are typically expressed in hexadecimal (base 16) notation.  Using just a single byte, we can get 256 values, and the first 128 (hex <c>00</c> to <c>7F</c>) are the <q>usual</q> Latin characters with some values used as control codes.  These 95 characters are the most basic, and will all render using <c>pdflatex</c> or <c>xelatex</c> with no special setup (and will render easily in HTML).  <c>U+0000</c> to <c>U+001F</c> are control codes and not used here.  <c>U+007F</c> is also a control code and so is excluded, while <c>U+0020</c> is a space, so appears invisible in the table.  In the source we have authored each character by its escaped version using its Unicode number (in hexadecimal).  So, for example, capital-B is authored as <c>&amp;#x0042;</c>.</p>

                <p>A monospace font is critical for samples of keyboard input and to distinguish exact technical input from running commentary.  We list here all of the reasonable characters from the first 256 Unicode code points.  (We skip the same 65 control characters from above, and the soft hyphen.)  These should all render fine in HTML and when processed with <c>xelatex</c>, however our focus with this sample article for PDF output is the capabilities when processed with <c>pdflatex</c>.  First, characters from <c>U+0000</c><ndash /><c>U+007F</c>.</p>

                <p>Note that the single and double quotes are upright and dumb, not curly and smart: <c>' " ' " ' "</c>.  And a backtick is a backtick: <c>` ` `</c>.  The zero is distinguished from the capital <q>oh</q>: <c>0 O 0 O 0 O</c>.  And the numeral one is slightly different from the lower-case <q>ell</q>: <c>1 l 1 l 1 l</c>.  The hyphen should be short and not expanded into some other kind of dash: <c>- - -</c>.  These characters should all cut/paste out of a PDF into a text editor with no conversion to other characters.</p>

                <p>Now the remaining characters from <c>U+0080</c><ndash /><c>U+00FF</c>.  The <c>program</c> tag is implemented in <latex /> via the <c>listing</c> package and these characters require ad-hoc replacements for processing by <c>pdflatex</c>.  (You can see the replacements in the preamble of the <latex /> source for this document.)  The replacement mechanism provided by the <c>listing</c> package will cause the characters below to produce a <latex /> compilation error if processed by <c>pdflatex</c> and in a table cell in certain situations (which we have avoided in the table below).  The only workaround in this case is to switch to <c>xelatex</c>.</p>

            <title>Pre-Formatted Text</title>

            <p>In Sage, if you wanted to build a matrix<idx>matrix</idx>, then you would use the <c>matrix()</c> constructor.  Here is the matrix of second partials of <m>f(x,y)=x^3+8x^2y^3 + y^4</m>, as you would enter it in Sage.  Notice that <c>SR</c> is the ring of symbolic expressions, <c>Symbolic Ring</c>.</p>

            <pre>
            var('x', 'y')
            J = matrix(SR, [
                [6*x + 16*y^3, 48*x*y^2],
                [48*x*y^2, 48*x^2*y + 12*y^2]
                ])
            </pre>

            <p>That accomplished, Sage will easily and naturally provide a <latex /> representation of the matrix with the command <c>latex(J)</c>.</p>

            <pre>
            \left(\begin{array}{rr}
            16 \, y^{3} + 6 \, x &amp; -48 \, x y^{2} \\
            48 \, x y^{2} &amp; 48 \, x^{2} y + 12 \, y^{2}
            \end{array}\right)
            </pre>

            <p>The <c>pre</c> element surrounds text that should be preserved verbatim.  It is like a special kind of paragraph, and can be used almost everywhere that a paragraph can be used.   The realization of preformatted text should be robust enough that it can be cut from documents and pasted without any substitutions of <q>fancier</q> Unicode characters for generic ASCII characters.  Try the <q>minus</q> sign on the <m>48</m> above to see if it does not become a dash, or the single quotes on the Sage variables.</p>

            <p>For Sage input code, the first non-whitespace character sets the left margin, since legitimate Python code has no subsequent lines outdented.  For pre-formatted code, the line with the <em>least</em> whitespace leading the line will determine the left margin.  If preserving indentation is important, do not mix spaces and tabs.  For syntax highlighting of text representing computer programs, or parts of them, see Section<nbsp /><xref ref="section-programs" />.  Examine the source of the following example to help understand this paragraph.</p>

            <pre>
            A normal line
                    An indented line
    An outdented line
            </pre>

            <p>Snippets should also be robust for cut/paste operations.  For example, you should not get <q>curly</q> <q>smart</q> quote marks in verbatim text: <c>this should have "dumb" quote marks</c>. Here are a few characters that should migrate through <latex /> to a PDF unmolested:  <c>'"----"'</c></p>

            <p><c>If you write a very long snippet of inline code (i.e. within a &lt;c&gt; element) it can impinge on the right margin, since very long words will not hypenate, unless you have a dash/hypen.  Such as when you use words like pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis, parastratiosphecomyia stratiosphecomyioides, floccinaucinihilipilification, or subdermatoglyphic.  For output in LaTeX we get line-breaking, and perhaps word-spacing, but we do not get hyphenation and the font is fixed-width.  So not always perfect.  Consider other options like &lt;cd&gt; or &lt;pre&gt; below.</c></p>

            <p>An intermediate type of verbatim text can be accomplished with the <tag>cd</tag> tag, short for <q>code display.</q>  It allows for larger chunks of verbatim text to show up in the middle of a paragraph, but with some vertical space above and below, and centered between the margins.  It can be<cd>authored as a single line</cd>or if you wish to have multiple lines<cd>
                <cline>there is the &lt;cline&gt; tag</cline>
                <cline>meant to model the line tag</cline>
                <cline>and short for "code line"</cline>
            </cd>and you may even<cd>
                <cline>use a single cline</cline>
            </cd>if you like to have your source closely model the visual look of the output.</p>

            <p>With the <attr>showspaces</attr> attribute of <tag>cd</tag> set to <c>all</c> there will be a visual indication of every space character, which is nice if indentation is critical.  For example,<cd showspaces="all">
                <cline>there is the &lt;cline&gt; tag</cline>
                <cline>    meant to model the line tag</cline>
                <cline>        and short for "code line"</cline>
            </cd> and as single line <cd showspaces="all">authored as a single line</cd> that is not structured with <tag>cline</tag> elements.</p>

            <p>The <tag>pre</tag> tag is meant for use outside of paragraphs, but is otherwise very similar.  The source may also be structured as a sequence of <tag>cline</tag> as in the next example, recycling content from above.</p>

            <pre>
                <cline>If you write a very long snippet of inline code (i.e. within</cline>
                <cline>a &lt;c&gt; element) it can impinge on the right margin, since</cline>
                <cline>very long words will not hypenate, unless you have a dash/hypen.</cline>
                <cline>Such as when you use words like</cline>
                <cline>pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis,</cline>
                <cline>parastratiosphecomyia stratiosphecomyioides,</cline>
                <cline>floccinaucinihilipilification, or subdermatoglyphic. For output</cline>
                <cline>in LaTeX we get line-breaking, and perhaps word-spacing, but we</cline>

            </pre>

            <p>We use a Unicode right arrow (Unicode Character 'RIGHTWARDS ARROW', U+2192) to sometimes indicate the truncation of long lines in a text file.  It is available in our usual monospace font for <latex/>/PDF, but we include a use here in order to make certain that is always the case.  Here: <c>&#x2192;</c>.</p>

            <p>Sage cells can be used for Python examples, but Sage uses a mild amount of pre-parsing, so that might not be a wise decision, especially in instructional settings.  We might implement Skulpt or Brython (in-browser Python) or the Python language argument to the Sage Cell Server.  To see examples of authoring Sage cells, have a look at Section<nbsp /><xref ref="section-sage-cells" />.</p>

            <p>In the meantime, program listings,<idx><h>listing</h></idx><idx><h>program listing</h></idx> especially with syntax highlighting, is useful all by itself.  The <q>R</q> language might not be a bad stand-in for pseudo-code, as it supports assignment with a left arrow and has fairly generic procedural syntax for control structures and data structures.  Or maybe Pascal would be a good choice?  Here is an example of R.  Note in the source that the entire block of code is wrapped in a CDATA section due to the four left angle brackets.  We do not recommend this technique for isolated problem characters, but it is a life-saver for situations like the <init>XSLT</init> code just following.</p>

            <p>You can write made-up pseudo-code, but you might explain to a reader what your symbols all mean.  This routine takes the <m>m\times n</m> marix <m>A</m> to reduced row-echelon form.  Note that with no language specified, there is no special formatting or use of color.  Note in the source the use of escaped characters for the three less-than symbols.</p>

            <p>Look in the <c>pretext-common.xsl</c> file to see the strings to use to identify languages.  Always all-lowercase, no symbols, no punctuation.</p>

            <p>Note that the above examples all have slightly different widths (theser are very evident in print with the frames).  As 2-D atomic objects, to place them in the narrative requires the layout features of a <c>sidebyside</c> element.  Then <c>width</c> and/or <c>margin</c> attributes will influence the width of the panel.</p>

            <p>A <c>program</c> may also be nested inside a <c>listing</c>, which behaves similar to a <c>figure</c>.  You can provide a <c>caption</c>, and the listing will be numbered along with tables and figures.  This then makes it possible to cross-reference the listing, such as <xref ref="listing-c-hello" text="type-global" />.  It also removes the requirement of wrapping the <c>program</c> in a <c>sidebyside</c>.  For technical reasons, the three examples above will not split across a page break in PDF output, but the placement inside a <c>listing</c> will allow splits, as you should see in at least one example following.</p>

            <p>If you are discussing algorithms in the abstract (or even concretely), you can set them off like a theorem, with a number, a title and a target for cross-references.  Sometimes you claim an algorithm produces something in particular, or has certain properties, such as a theoretical run time, so a proof may be included.  See the discussion just preceding about (limited) options for pseudo-code.</p>

            <algorithm xml:id="algorithm-sieve-eratosthenes">
                <title>Sieve of Eratosthenes</title>
                <statement>
                    <p>On input of a positive integer <c>n</c> this algorithm will compute all the prime numbers up to, and including, <c>n</c>.  It was named for Eratosthenes of Cyrene (<ca/> 276 BC<ndash /><ca /> 195/194 BC) by Nicomachus (<ca /> 60<ndash /><ca /> 120 CE) in <pubtitle>Introduction to Arithmetic</pubtitle>.

                        <li>Form the list of all integers from <c>2</c> to <c>n</c></li>
                        <li>Set <c>p = 2</c></li>
                        <li><p>While <c>p &lt; sqrt(n)</c><ol marker="1.">
                                <li>If present, remove from the list multiples <c>2p, 3p, ...</c></li>
                                <li>If <c>p</c> is now the last element of the list, stop</li>
                                <li>Otherwise, set <c>p</c> to the element of the list immediately after current <c>p</c></li>

                    </ol></p>
                </statement>

                <proof>
                    <p>Any element removed is a non-trivial product of two integers and hence composite.  So no prime is is ever removed from the list.</p>

                    <p>Each composite number is a multiple of some prime, and since no prime is ever removed, each composite will be removed.  Hence the removed elements are precisely the set of composite numbers in the list and thus the remainder are precisely the primes on the list.</p>
                </proof>
            </algorithm>

            <p>If you are writing about system-level software, you may need to write numbers in hexadecimal or binary.  Here we use a numbered, displayed equation (mathematics) and <latex /> macros such as <c>\texttt</c> for a monospace text font, and <c>\;</c> for spacing/grouping the bits of the binary number. <men>\texttt{6C2A}_{16} = \texttt{0110}\;\texttt{1100}\;\texttt{0010}\;\texttt{1010}_{2}</men>  If you use these constructions repeatedly, then some <latex /> macros might be useful.  It might also be beneficial for us to add some <pretext /> markup for such numbers used in a paragraph<mdash />send us a feature request.</p>

            <theorem xml:id="theorem-detached">
                <statement>
                    <p>This is a spurious theorem to break up the run of consecutive <c>listing</c> so we might test the effect.</p>
                </statement>
            </theorem>

            <p>And this is a spurious paragraph to prove that the theorem beforehand, and the proof following, are distinct from one another.</p>

            <p>A specialized version of a program listing is an interactive command/response session at a command-line, where differing fonts are used to differentiate the system prompt, the user's commands, and the system's reaction.  A   <c>console</c> session may be used by itself inside a <c>sidebyside</c>, or it can be wrapped in a listing to get a number and a caption.  As elsewhere, you will need to escape ampersands and angle brackets (such as if you have a command using redirection), using <c>&amp;amp;</c>, <c>&amp;lt;</c>, and <c>&amp;gt;</c> in your source.</p>

            <title>Units of Measure</title>

            <p>Units of measure can be given xml treatment too with the <c>quantity</c> element. In <latex />, the <c>siunitx</c><idx><h>siunitx package</h></idx><idx><h>package</h><h>siunitx</h></idx><idx><h>units</h></idx> package is loaded to achive unit handling. Since that package only offers SI units, some other common units will be added by <pretext/> in the preamble. In HTML, the capabilities of <c>siunitx</c> are simulated, weakly. Note that at present, you should not attempt to use the <c>quantity</c> element within a math environment.</p>
            <p>The value of gravitational constant <m>g</m> is <quantity><mag>9.8</mag><unit base="meter"/><per base="second" exp="2"/></quantity>. Force is measured in <quantity><unit prefix="kilo" base="gram"/><unit base="meter"/><per base="second" exp="2"/></quantity>, also known as one <quantity><unit base="newton"/></quantity>. A quantity with rather ridiculous units is <quantity><mag>23</mag><unit prefix='micro' base='hectare' exp='23'/><per base='degreeCelsius'/><per base='second' exp='2'/></quantity>. One <quantity><unit base="hertz"/></quantity> is the same as <quantity><per base='second'/></quantity>. You can have a unitless quantity, like <quantity><mag>42</mag></quantity>, which may help with consistency between such numbers and units in the <latex /> output. Some non-SI units are available, such as the absurd <quantity><unit base="degreeFahrenheit"/><unit base="foot"/><unit base="pound"/><per base="gallon"/></quantity>.  The <latex /> command <c>\pi</c> is recognized within <c>mag</c> in conversions to HTML, which is consistent with the behavior with a conversion to <latex />, for example there are
            <quantity>
                <mag>2\pi</mag>
                <unit base="radian"/>
            </quantity>
            in a full circle.  This is a similar quantity with multiple occurences of <c>\pi</c> to test a particular template used for HTML output.  It is not meant to make any sense:
            <quantity>
                <mag>21\pi45\pi234\pi890</mag>
                <unit base="radian"/>
            </quantity>.</p>

            <p>For a full list of the allowed units and prefixes, see <c>pretext-units.xsl</c>. If you have a need for more units, they need to be added to <c>pretext-units.xsl</c> in the section that deals with units which are not part of <c>siunitx</c> by default.  Note that the <c>mag</c> element should come first, followed by the <c>unit</c> element, followed by the <c>per</c> element.</p>

            <title>Side-By-Side Panels</title>

            <introduction>
                <title>Introduction</title>

                <p>The flow of a page is almost universally top-to-bottom.  But at times you would like to go <em>across</em> a page, perhaps to compare items (identical content in two different languages), or to make good use of a page real estate by grouping several small items together (<eg /> images).  So the <tag>sidebyside</tag> tag is strictly a layout device, though it does convey some meaning by grouping certain objects together. A variety of different objects can be put side-by-side using the <c>sidebyside</c> element.  Specifically, <c>figure</c>, <c>image</c>, <c>tabular</c>, <c>p</c>, <c>ol</c>, <c>ul</c>, <c>dl</c>, <c>pre</c>, <c>poem</c>, and more.  The individual components of a <tag>sidebyside</tag> are generically called <term>panels</term><idx>panels</idx>.</p>

                <p>As a layout device, the <tag>sidebyside</tag> does not allow a <tag>caption</tag>, is never numbered, and therefore cannot be cross-referenced.  You may cross-reference whatever element holds the <tag>sidebyside</tag>, and many of the panels may be cross-referenced individually.</p>

                <p>As a first example, we have two single paragraphs, laid out with different widths, and slight margins on each side.  The widths have been chosen experimentally to get roughly identical heights for the two paragraphs of varying length.</p>

                <sidebyside widths="60% 31%" margins="3%">

            <subsection>
                <title>Figures with Numbers Side-By-Side</title>

                <p>Figures, or other captioned items such as tables or listings, can be placed side-by-side using the <c>sidebyside</c> element.  The figures will be captioned and numbered as if they were part of the vertical flow of the document.  For example, see <xref ref="regular-figure" text="type-global"/> and <xref ref="another-regular-figure" text="type-global"/></p>

                <p>However, if the <tag>sidebyside</tag> is placed inside another <tag>figure</tag>, then the outer figure gets an overall caption and a <q>regular</q> number, while the captions of the interior items will be labelled as (a), (b), (c), etc; for example, see the subfigures in <xref ref="fig-sidebyside-global" text="type-global"/>. You can also cross-reference the subfigures individually, for example: <xref ref="fig-sidebyside-subfigure" text="type-global"/>.</p>

                <p>The <c>sidebyside</c> tag can have an attribute <c>widths</c> that specifies a percentage width of the page for each panel of the layout.  There are automatic margins by default, and any remaining width is divided evenly to space out the panels.  When the <c>margins</c> attribute is given as <c>auto</c>, or in the default case, the margins provided each equal half of the inter-panel space.</p>

                <p>With no attributes on the <c>sidebyside</c>, each panel is the same width and there is no inter-panel space and no margin.  For a <c>sidebyside</c> with a single panel, with its width specified, the panel will be centered.</p>

            <subsection>
                <title>Images</title>

                <p>We can use the <c>sidebyside</c> element to put <c>images</c><idx>image</idx> next to each other.  These will illustrate a text, but with no captions or numbers, cannot be cross-referenced.  This next example has <c>10%</c> margins, and the panels have widths <c>25%</c> and <c>40%</c>, leaving <c>15%</c> computed as the one inter-panel space.</p>

                <sidebyside widths="25% 40%" margins="10%">
                    <image source="images/cross-square.png"/>
                    <image source="images/cross-square.png"/>
                </sidebyside>

                <p>Now we fine-tune with different widths (which add up to 100%).  The five images have been given different vertical alignments, <c>top middle bottom top middle</c> via the <c>valigns</c> attribute.</p>

                <sidebyside widths="10% 30% 20% 20% 20%" margins="0%" valigns="top middle bottom top middle">
                    <image source="images/cross-square.png"/>
                    <image source="images/cross-square.png"/>
                    <image source="images/cross-square.png"/>
                    <image source="images/cross-square.png"/>
                    <image source="images/cross-square.png"/>
                </sidebyside>

                <p>If you want an overall caption to a group of images, but no sub-captions on your images, that is also straightforward.  This example has no attributes specified.  The overall <tag>figure</tag> may be cross-referenced, as <xref ref="figure-double-image" text="type-global" /></p>

                <figure xml:id="figure-double-image">
                    <caption>Two equally-spaced (identical) images</caption>

                <title>Common Side-By-Side Constructions</title>

                <p>We have now seen at least one example of each of the four most common constructions involving <c>sidebyside</c>.  Working from the exterior inward, we can go <c>figure</c>, <c>sidebyside</c>, <c>figure</c>, <c>X</c>, where <c>X</c> is some atomic (unnumbered) item we might use elsewhere in a <pretext /> document, the inner <c>figure</c> may be repeated with different objects <c>X</c>, and the <c>figure</c>s have captions.  Each <c>figure</c> is independently optional, leading to the four combinations in this table.  Note this applies to any captioned item used inside the <c>sidebyside</c>, but a <c>figure</c> is the most flexible.</p>

                <p>Text can be put next to other blocks of text using the <c>stack</c> element, which can contain multiple paragraphs using the <c>p</c> element (see <xref ref="stacking-side-by-side" text="type-global" />).  If only one paragraph is required, simply use the <c>p</c> element on its own.</p>

                <title>Image Formats, Side-by-Sides</title>

                <p>Most of our demonstrations here use our square <q>blue cross</q> test image, which is provided as a <init>PNG</init> image.  You may specify images by any of the methods described in the section on graphics, <xref ref="graphics" text="type-global" />.  The complete graph below is specified with no file extension, on the assumption that an <init>SVG</init> version exists for <init>HTML</init> output, and a <init>PDF</init> version exists for <latex /> output.  The second is a <init>JPEG</init> image that we use elsewhere for a YouTube video, but recycle here as an image provided in that format.  By default, they are aligned at their tops.</p>

                <sidebyside widths="30% 30%" margins="auto">
                    <image source="images/complete-graph" />
                    <image source="images/led-zeppelin-kashmir.jpg" archive="jpg" />
                </sidebyside>

                <p>Here are two TikZ images, authored side-by-side.  The first has had its geometric portions of the original scaled down to 75%, with the effect of increasing the text, relatively, so the application in a side-by-side panel with 25% width has legible text.  We caption only the second panel, which has no text adjustments.  From <url href="http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/" visual="www.texample.net/tikz/examples/">TeXample.net</url>.</p>

                <p>A <q>regular</q> list normally belongs in a <c>p</c> but it can be placed unadorned into a panel of a side-by-side, as demonstrated below in <xref ref="subsection-sbs-other-panels" text="type-global" />.  You can also put <q>named</q> lists into a panel, and then the title, introduction, conclusion, and caption will behave as expected, along with a number that might be used in a cross-reference (<xref ref="color-list-as-panel" text="global" />), or perhaps we might cross-reference by title, <xref ref="color-list-as-panel" text="title" />.</p>

                <title>Stacking: Back to Vertical Flow</title>

                <p>You might wish to mix disparate items within a panel, returning to a vertical flow within a panel.  For example, you might want a diagram to the left and some paragraphs of commentary to the right.  Or perhaps a photograph on one side and a list of bullet points to the other side.  A <tag>stack</tag> is a container that can only be used to collect several items into a single panel of a <tag>sidebyside</tag>.  You cannot point to it, but you can point to its contents as usual.  Contents may be anything you could otherwise put into a <c>sidebyside</c> panel that does not have a <tag>caption</tag> or a <tag>title</tag>.  In particular, these panels cannot be sub-numbered since the panel cannot be made into a <tag>figure</tag>.</p>

                <p>Similar items can also be stacked, of course.  Most importantly, a normal panel will accept a single paragraph.  If you want several paragraphs, simply collect them in a <c>stack</c>.</p>

                <sidebyside widths="55% 35%" valigns="middle top">
                    <stack>
                        <p>A simple sentence inside a single <tag>p</tag> as the first item in a stack.</p>
                        <image source="images/cross-rectangle.png" />
                    </stack>
                    <stack>
                        <image source="images/cross-rectangle.png" />
                        <p>A less simple sentence that will wrap inside the panel to make the right panel taller and allow us to experiment with sliding the left panel contents up and down, here it is placed in the <c>middle</c>.</p>
                    </stack>
                </sidebyside>

                <p>We have an image to the left, as a regular panel (not a stack).  In the right panel we stack a list of properties, followed by a descriptive paragraph.  We middle-align the stack at the <c>bottom</c>, just as a demonstration (it would likely look better with <c>top</c> alignment).</p>

                <sidebyside widths="60% 30%" valigns="top bottom">
                    <image source="images/cross-square.png" />

                            <li>Blue</li>
                            <li>Square</li>
                            <li>Geometric</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The blue-ness of the border contrasts with the stark emptieness of the white interior, evoking images of blue skies and vast sandy deserts.  The harsh black cross draws the viewer's attention to the exact center.</p>
                    </stack>
                </sidebyside>

                <p>In <latex /> an image or a tabular can be used <em>within</em> a paragraph.  Here we test a mixture of the three items to make sure they are properly separated in a conversion to <latex />.</p>

                    <image source="images/cross-square.png"/>
                </sidebyside>

                <p>We imagine a <tag>sidebyside</tag> using a <tag>stack</tag> to enable constructions like a table of data in one panel, and maybe a plot with some text next to it.</p>

                <p>In the toy example next, the list of data is rigid, so we have set the first panel width to <c>40%</c>, a value obtained experimentally to just contain the list.  This allow us to set the second panel to a width of <c>58%</c>, and we use no margins.  If you try to balance the heights of the two panels, this can become a bit of a zero-sum game.  A wider second column means the text occupies fewer lines, but the wider image also creates a taller image, consuming more vertical space.</p>

                    <p>Remember that <tag>sidebyside</tag> has attributes that strongly influence layout.  That is intentional.  But to support a variety of output formats, it does not allow overly-precise control, and they be viewed as providing <em>hints</em> to an implementer of a conversion.  So for example, do not expect <tag>sidebyside</tag> to function like a <latex /> <c>tabular</c> or an <init>HTML</init> <c>table</c>.</p>

                    <p>In particular, elements of two consecutive <tag>stack</tag> will not line up, unless perhaps you construct them identically.  Consider a <tag>sbsgroup</tag> for something closer to putting items into rows.</p>

                <p>Pre-formatted text may be included by using the <c>pre</c> element.  This content is horizontally-rigid, so as the author, you need to be sure to provide enough width for the panel to contain the content.  It is easy to see the boundary of the panels when rendered in HTML since there is a background that fills the panel.</p>

                <p>Poems are not horizontally-rigid, but they are not perfectly horizontally-flexible either.  The left copy of this next poem is in a panel roughly 2/3 the width of the page and fits there.  The right copy has the first five lines and is in space about half the previous width, and you can see the lines being wrapped with obvious indentation.  So you <em>can</em> constrain the width of a poem if you do not mind the additional indentation.  (Recognize that this example is a bit extreme.)</p>

                <p>A <q>side-by-side group,</q> <tag>sbsgroup</tag>, is still in development.  (Notably, subcaptions do not behave as expected.)  It is a sequence of <c>sidebyside</c>, which may conceivably use the same margins, widths and vertical alignments for each horizontal run of panels.  Attributes on the <c>sbsgroup</c> are global to the group's enclosed <c>sidebyside</c>, and will be used by each contained <c>sidebyside</c>.  If attributes are present on an individual <c>sidebyside</c>, they override the global values.  The next two examples demonstrate some of this behavior, in a limited way.</p>

                <p>A long poem, when placed into a <c>sidebyside</c> will not fit onto a physical page and will not break across pages.  With a <c>sbsgroup</c> you can put each stanza (say) into its own <c>sidebyside</c> and place something (commentary) next to it.  We include the <c>title</c> with the first stanza and the <c>author</c> with the last stanza.  This device can also be useful to attach commentary to specific stanzas.</p>

                <p>The main rationale for <c>sbsgroup</c> is to layout a grid of items, and by placing the layout parameters on the <c>sbsgroup</c> element, the items can line up across <c>sidebyside</c> and subcaptioning can run across the whole group.  So, for example, if you have images to compare by placing in a grid, then making them all the same size, or of the same aspect ratio, can help with the overall consistency.</p>

                <p>This example has three <c>sidebyside</c>, each with four <c>figure</c> containing an identical <c>image</c>.  Since the images are identical and the <c>width</c> is set to 20% they should all line up nicely with little effort.  Since the default for margins is automatic, the remaining 20% of the overall width will be used for three inter-panel spaces of 5% and two margins of 2.5% each.  Note the numbering of these as independent figures.  We have left the captions empty for reasons of space, but you could add more information.  Note that in print, a page break is allowed between any two of the <c>sidebyside</c> and cannot be suppressed.</p>

            <p>This subsection attempts to survey all the possible items that can be placed into a <c>sidebyside</c> element, in various combinations.  While intended to be exhaustive across contents, it does not test all possibilities, and is not meant to be instructive (see <xref ref="section-side-by-side" text="type-global" /> for that). The layout is identical for each <c>sidebyside</c>, 5% margins, panel widths of 40% and 45%, leaving 5% for the space between the panels.  The vertical alignment is left at the default, <c>top</c>.</p>

            <p>Be aware that the lines of <c>pre</c> can spill outside of its panel without any word-wrapping.  So you may need to vary panel widths or rearrange line breaks manually.  Page width is a scarce resource.</p>

            <p>Images will scale to fill their panel's width.  We provide no services to change the aspect ratio of your images, that is your responsibility to accomplish elsewhere.  This rectangular image will have slightly different widths, and so will be slightly deeper in the right panel (at a 45:40 ratio).  Remember, vertical alignment is at the top.</p>

            <p>Now we turn to <q>captioned</q> items: <c>figure</c>, <c>table</c>, <c>listing</c>, and the anomalous <q>named list</q>, <c>list</c>, whose future is uncertain.  We test subcaptions here.  Note that many different atomic items can go in a figure, and largely they will behave in a <c>sidebyside</c> much as they do when placed in a panel all by themselves (<ie /> captionless).</p>

            <p>Videos can be placed quite compactly for HTML output, but we display a fair amount of information for a YouTube video in print, and therefore two videos side-by-side gets pretty crowded.  The examples above have the bare minimum amount of information attached (not in an overarching <c>figure</c>), and the bare amount which which is displayed in print.  We could relax our common spacing to make it a bit better.  Read about <q>side-by-side</q> groups (<c>sbsgroup</c>) and experiment with stacking several sub-captioned videos into an overall captioned figure (<xref ref="subsection-sbsgroup" text="type-global" />).

                <p>Some <pretext/> objects are relatively indivisable and are used as components of other structures.  We call them <term>atomic</term>, even if the term is not perfect.  A good example is <tag>image</tag> (next, <xref ref="atomic-image"/>).  This section is arranged according to these objects and tests the various ways they can be employed.</p>

            <subsection xml:id="atomic-image">
                <title><tag>image</tag></title>

                <p>An <tag>image</tag> can be placed in five different ways:<ol>
                    <li>all by itself, as a peer of <tag>p</tag> typically, with layout control,</li>
                    <li>inside a <tag>figure</tag>, earning a number and caption,</li>
                    <li>inside a <tag>sidebyside</tag>, with size and layout configured,</li>
                    <li>inside a <tag>figure</tag> inside a <tag>sidebyside</tag>, with size and layout configured, with a number and caption, and</li>
                    <li>inside a <tag>figure</tag> inside a <tag>sidebyside</tag> inside a <tag>figure</tag>, with size and layout configured, with a number and caption, but now sub-numbered ((a), (b), (c),<ellipsis/>).</li>
                </ol>Examples of each, and more.</p>

                <p>All by itsef, with no layout specified, so showing the default size and placement.  Vivamus in congue massa. Morbi condimentum ac magna at accumsan. Vestibulum ac augue eu lorem semper gravida.</p>

                <image source="images/nz-landscape.jpg"/>

                <p>Width set at 40%, so equal margins and thus centered.  Aenean faucibus augue tellus, et sollicitudin tortor finibus non. Maecenas semper dolor quis diam placerat, iaculis sollicitudin augue finibus. Vestibulum facilisis ligula lectus, ac tristique nisl aliquet non.</p>

                <image source="images/nz-landscape.jpg" width="40%"/>

                <p>Asymmetric margins of 20% and 40% given, implying 40% width, equal to previous instance.  Vivamus suscipit diam eget mi cursus viverra.</p>

                <image source="images/nz-landscape.jpg" margins="20% 40%"/>

                <p>As a plain component of a <tag>sidebyside</tag>.  Widths here are 20% and 30%, margins and gaps are automatic, default alignment on top edges.  Nulla pharetra imperdiet elit, in sodales nibh blandit ultricies. Maecenas efficitur ac felis ut pharetra.</p>

                <sidebyside widths="20% 30%">

                    <image source="images/nz-landscape.jpg"/>
                </sidebyside>

                <p>Inside a <tag>figure</tag> with no adjustments, so default behavior.  Note how a <tag>figure</tag> occupies the entire width of the page, so then does the caption.</p>

                <p>
                    For <latex/>, in some circumstances it is desirable to print the image on the next line, but backed up by some amount.
                    This <q>top-aligns</q> the image with a number of some sort off to the left. The following are tests for this behavior.
                    Here is a list.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <image margins="0% 70%" source="images/nz-landscape.jpg"/>

                </p>

                <p>A <c>rotation="n"</c> attribute applied to a bare image will rotate the image by n<degree/>. The vertical space adjusts to accomodate the rotated image in the latex version but not in the html version.</p>

                <p>A <tag>program</tag> with a <attr>width</attr> attribute, so centered and with equal margins.  Note how the lines word wrap due to the smaller width.</p>

                </program>

                <p>A <tag>program</tag> with short lines, so significant, and asymmetric margins, which experimentally do not induce any word-wrapping.</p>

                    <code>

            <subsection xml:id="atomic-tabular">
                <title><tag>tabular</tag></title>

                <p>A <tag>tabular</tag> can be placed in six different ways:<ol>


                    <li>all by itself, as a peer of <tag>p</tag> typically, with no layout control and hence with a <q>natural width,</q> and centered</li>
                    <li>all by itself, as a peer of <tag>p</tag> typically, with explicit layout control,</li>
                    <li>inside a <tag>table</tag>, earning a number and title,</li>
                    <li>inside a <tag>sidebyside</tag>, with size and layout configured,</li>
                    <li>inside a <tag>table</tag> inside a <tag>sidebyside</tag>, with size and layout configured, with a number and title, and</li>
                    <li>inside a <tag>table</tag> inside a <tag>sidebyside</tag> inside a <tag>figure</tag>, with size and layout configured, with a number and title, but now sub-numbered ((a), (b), (c),<ellipsis/>).</li>
                </ol>Examples of each, and more.</p>

                <p>A <tag>tabular</tag> realized by <latex/> for PDF/print will normally be as wide as necessary to hold the content, without word-wrapping the content of any cell that is not explicitly authored that way.  This is the most rigid of the content types we call <q>planar.</q>  So for <pretext/> output as <latex/>, when you explicitly constrain the width to be less than the <q>natural width</q> (including use as a panel of a <tag>sidebyside</tag>, or even setting margins) the table will be scaled <em>down</em> in width, which can result in an apparent font size very much smaller than that of the surrounding text.  Note that we do not ever scale a tabular up to be wider with a larger font size.  Note also that if there is no attempt to control the space for the table (no layout control, not in a <tag>sidebyside</tag>) then no scaling is attempted at all and the table may be wider than the text and protrude into the right margin.  For more, see the three examples at: <xref ref="natural-too-wide" text="type-global"/> , <xref ref="scale-down-auto" text="type-global"/>, <xref ref="scale-down-100" text="type-global"/>.  Generally, much of the commentary and testing here is about <latex/>/PDF/print.  While for <init>HTML</init> output the cells will usually automatically word-wrap to fit in the available space, without adjusting the font size.  Some might like this behavior and some might not.</p>

                <p>Data in a table form can be placed in amongst a series of paragraphs.  With no layout control, it will occupy its <q>natural width</q> and be centered.</p>

                <p>In amongst a run of paragraphs (or similar) a <tag>tabular</tag> can be placed with layout control.  For <latex/> output, this will scale the table to fit within the explicit, or implicit, width.  This can result in obvious differences in the apparent font size.  We first have a <attr>width</attr> that is experimentally similar to the natural width, with asymetric margins.  Then a narrow width, and a wide width, as an illustration.</p>

                <p>The next table is purposely much too wide.  In <xref ref="natural-too-wide" text="type-global"/> we make no attempt to control the width, and so it will extend into the margins.  In <xref ref="scale-down-auto" text="type-global"/> we have simple added the attribute <c>width="auto"</c>.  This attempt to use layout control will cause an automatic reduction in width and a smaller apparent font size.  Adjusting margins providing an explicit percentage width, or placing the tabular as a panel of <tag>sidebyside</tag> will have the same effect.  In <xref ref="scale-down-100" text="type-global"/> we have set the width explicity to 100% and so it should be identical to the automatic width case just prior.</p>

            <introduction>
                <p>This section demonstrates the numbering<idx>numbering</idx> patterns used throughout <pretext />.  There are five subsections.  Two intermediate subsections each have two subsubsections.  This creates a total of seven divisions that are leaves of the document tree.  In each leaf we have placed two numbered theorems, for a total of fourteen.  There is no real content, this is just a demonstration.</p>

                <p>Use values of <c>0</c> through <c>3</c> for the <c>numbering.theorems.level</c> parameter to see how these numbers change accordingly.  It is easiest to compare if you use <c>chunk.level &lt; 2</c> so the theorems all land on the same page if you are previewing in HTML.</p>

                <conclusion>
                    <p>Conclusion now.  We include two theorems as numbered items in the conclusion to test their numbers, which are sometimes totally illogical and are inconsistent across output formats.  To see the effect, set the level for numbering theorems to <c>3</c>.  See this GitHub <url href="https://github.com/PreTeXtBook/pretext/issues/139" visual="github.com/PreTeXtBook/pretext/issues/139">Issue #139</url> for details.</p>

                <p>We have a lot of theorems in this section, so we illustrate including an automatic list of these here.  We use the <c>elements</c> attribute to limit the list to <c>theorem</c> elements, and we use the <c>scope</c> attribute to limit the list to this <c>section</c>.  You can use an introductory <c>p</c> like this one, or not.  The list gets no title or visual separation, so use the usual subdivision elements to make that happen.

                <title>Customizing Phrases</title>

                <p>There is a facility for providing alternate text for small or short phrases, or other components of a paragraph.  Here we just provide some tests.  Each is inside of a block quote to identify it clearly.</p>

                <p>We have two auxiliary files of custom elements, so you need to adjust the publisher file to specify the second one during testing.  First, a very simple string as the variation.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>This is an article about <custom ref="plural-animal"/>.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Now a string which is partially text and partially simple markup.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>We like to write with <custom ref="an-emotional-style"/>.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>And a mildly more complicated structure (a list) as the variable text.</p>

                <!-- List in "custom" so no space after "are" -->
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Some of our favorite colors are<custom ref="color-list"/></p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>A cross-reference to test, since context is critical.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>See also <custom ref="xref-to-result"/>.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>The URLs used as a replacement have the <attr>visual</attr> attribute which is also managed by the assembly pre-processor to provide a footnote.  So this is a good test of the organization of the multiple passes employed by the pre-processor.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>A <init>URL</init> that should have a footnote: <custom ref="a-URL"/>.</p>

            <title>Ancillaries</title>

            <p>Once your content is in place, you can begin thinking about various useful derivative works.  A natural example for a textbook is an <q>Instructor's Version</q>.  Various switches for hints, answers, and solutions to exercises would allow you to include more of these for the use of just an instructor.  Here we also demonstrate the <tag>commentary</tag> element.  It is similar in many ways to a <tag>paragraphs</tag> in that it can be placed within any division and must be titled.  The main difference is that it is not displayed by default, so you must set the string parameter <c>commentary</c> to the value <c>yes</c>. Other distinctions are:<ul>
                <li>Since it is elective, you need to be careful about cross-references to and from a <tag>commentary</tag>.  It is highly likely that you will want to make cross-references <em>within</em> a <tag>commentary</tag> <em>pointing to</em> other portions of your text, and this is always a good idea.  You will want to avoid making cross-references <em>to</em> a <tag>commentary</tag> from other parts of the text, with the exception of a cross-reference that originates <em>within</em> some <tag>commentary</tag>.</li>
                <li>Numbered items are prohibited within a <tag>commentary</tag>, such as a <tag>figure</tag> or a <tag>theorem</tag>.  Doing so would disrupt consecutive numbering in different versions, with or without, <tag>commentary</tag> included.  Numbered equations are not prohibited in the schema, but should definitely be avoided anyway.</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>After some nonsense text in a paragraph, there is a <tag>commentary</tag> with two paragraphs.  For the online version of this sample article, we have enabled commentaries.  But if you are experimenting yourself, you will want to be aware if you are enabling these or not.</p>

Recall that medians are the lines connecting the vertices of the triangle to the midpoints of their opposite edges, as in the figure. We'll do this in a few steps.</p>

                    <p>This two-page worksheet was generously donated to the sample article by Virgil Pierce at a CuratedCourses workshop in August<nbsp/>2018.

                        <p> The sum of the voltages around any closed circuit (or subcircuit) is zero.

                    <p> Kirchoffs Current Law and Kirkoffs Voltage Law combined with Ohms Law gives for any circuit of resistors and sources a linear system that may (or may not) determine the currents.

            <title>Exercises, One Subsection</title>

            <p>This <tag>section</tag> of the sample article demonstrates an <q>unstructured division.</q>  There are no <tag>subsection</tag>, you are just reading the first two paragraphs, followed by some nonsense text.  Then there is a <em>single</em> <tag>exercises</tag> division.  Note that this division is not numbered (since it is unique within the <tag>section</tag>).  And a cross-reference to one of the contained <tag>exercise</tag> will be numbered as a member of the <tag>section</tag>, <xref ref="exercise-challenging-one-unstructured" text="type-global" />.</p>

            <p>If you use the unstructured form of a division, <em>and</em> have both inline and divisional exercises, there is a potential to form ambiguous cross-references.  To wit, check that <xref ref="duplicate-inline" text="global" /> and <xref ref="duplicate-divisional" text="global" /> are really different exercises (which you are <em>unable to do</em> if you are reading this in print!).  The solution is to include the type of exercise in the reference, which will assist everybody, but especially your print readers:  <xref ref="duplicate-inline" text="type-global" /> and <xref ref="duplicate-divisional" text="type-global" />.</p>

            <p>Compare this section with the similar <xref ref="exercises-multiple" text="type-global" />, next.  The following text is mostly nonsense, just for testing purposes.</p>

                <solution>
                    <p>Maybe a global switch should be used to suppress solutions, while a separate processing regime could use them as part of a solutions manual.</p>

                    <p>This is an introduction, where you might explain that this division of the back matter contains various hints, answers, solutions of inline exercises, divisional exercises, project-like blocks, worksheet exercises, and/or reading questions.  See the source to see just how this solutions division was built.</p>

                <introduction>
                    <p>Sometimes you may want the solutions to exercises within a single <tag>exercises</tag> division (or similar, like a <tag>worksheet</tag>).  Default behavior in this situation can produce two titles, when just one would be sufficient.  Here we have used the <attr>scope</attr> attribute to point to a specific <tag>exercises</tag>, and provided a (single) very specific <tag>title</tag>.</p>

                <introduction>
                    <p>The back matter solutions appendix requests every <tag>answer</tag>, and only <tag>answer</tag>, of all types of exercises: inline, divisional, worksheet, reading questions, and projects.  Now, as observed by Bruce Yoshiwara, it gets a bit tedious to see the <q>Answer</q> heading over and over in print, when every entry has that heading.  So we squelch it for you in print/PDF output.  (For <init>HTML</init> output we use knowls and need to have something to click on.  But perhaps for <init>EPUB</init> we should be more careful?)  Note that you might want to use a <tag>title</tag>, or an <tag>introduction</tag>, that explains which component of the exercises is being displayed, so there is no confusion.</p>

                <introduction>
                    <p>This should be identical to the previous collection of answers, <em>except</em> only exercises with an even number are reported (via the <attr>admit</attr> attribute).</p>

                <title>List of Results</title>

                <p>We had an automatic list of theorems for just one section, back in <xref ref="subsection-local-theorems" text="type-global" />.  Here we expand to include <c>corollary</c> in our space-delimited list of <c>elements</c> and we request <c>divisions</c> (headings) at each <c>subsection</c> and <c>section</c>.  The default <c>scope</c> is the entire document, which is appropriate here in the backmatter.  There are many subsections with no results, so we set the <c>empty</c> attribute to <c>no</c> to suppress them, though this is the default behavior (<c>yes</c> being the other option to see divisions with no list items).  These lists are most valuable if you are in the practice of giving items titles.</p>

                <p>Since <tag>exercise</tag> come in several flavors, we use <term>pseudo-elements</term> to specify the distinct types.  There are not many reading questions<mdash/>but here is a list of all of them, by section, using a <c>readingquestion</c> pseudo-element.</p>

                <list-of elements="readingquestion" divisions="section" empty="no"/>

                <p>And now a list of all the inline exercises, and including the title of every <tag>section</tag>, even if there is no inline exercise contained inside it.  The pseudo-element is <c>inlineexercise</c>.</p>

            <appendix label="appendix-index">
                <title>Index</title>

                <p>There is an index manufactured at the end of the back matter.  So we are talking about it here, rather than within the index, which is an impossibility.  It contains some sample entries, and is not meant to be comprehensive.  Look at the source of this XML file, searching on <tag>idx</tag>, to see how they are written.  They may be placed inside of a a variety of structures, and their location greatly influences the cross-references produced in the HTML version of the index.</p>

                <p>The <latex /> version of the index is more traditional, using page numbers to reference locations.  A newer package is used to create the index, and so there is no extra intermediate step required to process the index.  The one downside of this convenience is that index entries may not be placed in the back colophon (which is the only subdivision that may follow the index).</p>

                <p>There is an index entry about multicolumn lists which spans more than one page.  This requires doubly-linked index entries, the first has the index content and points to the <c>xml:id</c> of the second.  The second is an empty element, but points back to the <c>xml:id</c> of the first entry.  So each has a marker and a reference, which allows the span of the index topic to cut across XML boundaries in the source.  This is the mechanism to produce a page range in the <latex /> index.  See the source of this article for syntax details.</p>

                <paragraphs>
                    <title>Bully Pulpit: Index Headings</title>

                    <p>Professionals do not capitalize the headings (entries) of an index, unless it is a proper noun (name, place, <etc />).  We do not provide any enforcement of this advice, nor any assistance.  It is your responsibility to provide quality source material in this regard.</p>

                    <p>Most all of the index entries below to page 2 (PDF output) are just from a suite of non-sensical tests.  These are harder to recognize in the <init>HTML</init> output.</p>

                    <p>You might want to have lists of references, in the back, but with multiple such lists.  Make an <tag>appendix</tag> to hold them, give it some structure (for an <tag>article</tag>, a leading <tag>subsection</tag>, such as the one you are reading right now), then follow with multiple <tag>references</tag> divisions.  A typical citation will then look like: <xref ref="biblio-strang-article-tres"/>.</p>
