            <p>Sage can compute definite integrals.  The output contains the approximate numerical value of the definite integral, followed by an upper bound  of the error in the approximation.</p>

                <output>1/2*x - 1/4*sin(2*x)</output>
            </sage>

            <p>The same command can be used to employ the antiderivative in the application of the Fundamental Theorem.  Notice that the answer is <em>exact</em> and any further manipulation is likely to be simply producing a numerical approximation.</p>

            <p>There are integrals you really do not want to evaluate, or you do not want your reader to evaluate.  A Sage cell can be configured for display purposes only <mdash /> you can look but you cannot touch.</p>

            </sage>

            <p>You can give a Sage element a <c>doctest</c> attribute, whose value mirrors the optional hash tags used in Sage doctests.  Possible values are <c>random</c>, <c>long time</c>, <c>not implemented</c>, <c>not tested</c>, <c>known bug</c>, <c>absolute</c>, <c>relative</c>, and <c>optional</c>.  The values <c>absolute</c> and <c>relative</c> refer to floating-point tolerances for equality and require a second attribute <c>tolerance</c> to specify a floating point value.  The value <c>optional</c> refers to the test requiring that an optional Sage package be present.  The name of that package should be provided in the <c>package</c> attribute.</p>

            <p>The next cell is marked in the source as <c>doctest="random"</c>, and so is specified as unpredictable and not tested.  But there is some <q>sample</q> output which will appear in the <latex /> version (and always be the same).</p>

            <sage doctest="random">
                <input>random()</input>
                <output>0.11736021338650582</output>
            </sage>

            <p>While the next cell is random, the returned value will never be more than <m>0.01</m> away from <m>12</m>, since the <c>random()</c> function stays between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>.  So we provide <m>12.005</m> as the expected answer, but test with an absolute tolerance of <m>\epsilon=0.006</m>.</p>

            <sage doctest="absolute" tolerance="0.006">
                <input>12 + 0.01*random()</input>
                <output>12.005</output>
            </sage>

            <p>Sage, and by extension, the Sage Cell Server, can interpret several languages.  The next example has code in the <c>R</c> language, a popular open source language for statistics.  As an author, you add the attribute <c>language="r"</c> to your <c>sage</c> element.  (The default language is Sage, so you do not need to indicate that repeatedly.)  Note that a language like <c>R</c> likes to use a <q>less than</q> character, the second most-dangerous special character in XML.  You need to escape it by writing <c>&amp;lt;</c> as we have done in the source for this example.  (See the discussion and summary in <xref ref="subsection-reserved-characters" autoname="yes" />.)</p>

            <p>As a reader you learn that the <q>Evaluate</q> button for a pre-loaded Sage cell will indicate the language in use.</p>

            <p>Here is a blank Sage cell that you may use for practice and experimentation with the commands above.  Note that this cell allows a choice of languages, and is not linked with any of the previous cells, so a reader would need to start fresh, or cut/paste definitioons from other cells.</p>

            <sage type="practice" />

            <p>On the other hand a <c>&lt;sage&gt;</c> element with no content will also create an empty Sage cell for the reader's use, but now it will be specific to a particular language and linked to others of the same language.  Run the <c>R</c> cell above that defines the variable <c>ruth</c> and then try typing <c>summary(ruth)</c> in the cell below.  (The linking seems a bit buggy, as it repeats the boxplot in the output, as of 2016-06-13).</p>

            <sage language="r" />

            <p>You can make Sage blocks which are of <c>type="invisible"</c>, which will never be shown to a reader, but which get doctested.  Why do this?  If some code produces an error, and you hope it is fixed someday, use an invisible block to raise the error.  Once fixed, the doctest will fail, and you can adjust your commentary to suit.  There is such a block right now, <em>but</em> you will need to go to the source to see it.</p>

            <p>Our maximum width for text, designed for readability, suggests you should format your Sage code with a maximum of about 54 characters. On a mobile device, the number of displayed characters might be as low as 28 in portrait orintation, and again around 50 in landscape.  You can use a variety of techniques to shorten long lines, such as using intermediate variables.  Since Sage is just a huge Python library, you can use any of Python's facilities for handling long lines.  These include a continuation character (which I try to avoid using) or natural places where you can break long lines, such as between entries of a list.  Also, if writing loops or functions, you may wish to have your indentation be only two characters wide (rather than, say, four).</p>

            <p>Sage output can sometimes be quite long, though this has improved with some changes in Sage's output routines.  Output code should be included primarily for doctesting purposes, and in this use, you may break at almost whitespace character and the doctesting framework will adjust accordingly.  You may wish to show sample output in a static format, like a PDF, so you can consider formatting your output to fit the width constraints of that medium.  Or you may even adjust exactly what is output, to keep it from being too verbose.  Sage doctesting also allows for a wild-card style syntax which allows you to skip over huge chunks of meaningless or unpredictable output, such as tracebacks on error messages.</p>

        <!--
        Next section illustrates more involved presentation of
        mathematics.  The "mdn" element is shorthand for
        "mathematics display, numbered".  There is a "men"
        element for "math equation, numbered" and a "md" for
        "math display" (with no numbers).  Numbering may be
        selectively suppressed or enabled, per line (shown
        here once).  An "xml:id" alias may be used on any
        numbered line.

        Multi-line displays ("md", "mdn") require that lines
        be delimited as "math rows" with the "mrow" element.
        These displays are implemented with the AMSMath align
        environment, which uses ampersands (&) for formatting
        control.  This is an evil situation, but the (easy) way
        around it is to use "&amp;" in this situation.

        The previous sections were sequences of paragraphs, along with
        theorems, Sage code, etc.  The next section has subsections, so
        the structure must look like *only* subsections, excepting a
        brief introduction and conclusion (that are sequences of
        paragraphs and other blocks.)

                    <p>Using an <q>integral sign</q> for an antiderivative (aka indefinite integral) would seem to make the Fundamental Theorem a <foreign>fait accompli</foreign>.

                            <p>This is an example of an example with a bit more structure.  Specifically, the example has a <c>title</c>, as usual, but then has a <c>statement</c>, which is separate from the <c>solution</c>.  Why did we implement an example in two ways?</p>

                <conclusion>
                    <p>Entirely analogous to introductions are conclusions.  Any subdivision may have a sequence of paragraphs within a <c>&lt;conclusion&gt;</c> that follows previous further subdivisions.  You are reading one now.  They are always leaves of the document structure, so are rendered on some pages that reference the preceding subdivisions.</p>

                   <p>This concludes this conclusion (and this subsection and this section).</p>

            <p>Lists can have multiple columns.  With <init>HTML</init> items displayed in row-major order (horizontally first) and with <latex /> items are displayed in column-major order (vertically first).  When one order, or the other, becomes workable in both variants, maybe we will be consistent in presentation.  (Note that with just one row, it makes no difference.)  We used it above for the two items <mdash /> derivatives and integrals <mdash /> where each item was a list of its own.

                <title>Automatically Defining Sage Code</title>

                <p>There is a bit of Sage code in the source for this section, defined at the beginning.  It is both (a) hidden, and (b) automatically evaluated.  It's effect is to define a function <c>square()</c>, which  will square a number.  The next (visible) cell will demonstrate the effect.  This will work as along as the initialization code and it's use are on the same webpage (which will depend on how you decide to break up your document into pages).</p>

            <title>Some Advanced Ideas</title>

            <todo>Move index-finish marker back once it is allowed other places</todo>

            <p><index xml:id="index-finish-multicolumn" start="index-start-multicolumn" />The multi-row displayed mathematics in the proof of the Fundamental Theorem had equations aligned on the equals signs via the <ampersand /> character.  Sometimes you don't want that.  Here is an example with some differential equations, with each equation centered and unnumbered,<md>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y')(s) = s {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - y(0) = s Y(s) - y(0)</mrow>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y'')(s) = s^2 {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)= s^2 Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0).</mrow>
            </md></p>

            <p><latex /> has a device where you can interrupt a sequence of equations with a small amout of text and preserve the equation alignment on eithr side.  Here are two tests of that device, with aligned equations and non-aligned equations.  Study the source to see use and differences.  (The math does not make sense.)  Aligned and numbered first.</p>

            <p><mdn>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y')(s)  &amp;= s {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - y(0) = s Y(s) - y(0)</mrow>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y'')(s) &amp;= s^2 {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)= s^2 Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0).</mrow>
                <intertext>And so it follows that,</intertext>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y')(s)^{++}  &amp;= s {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - y(0) = s Y(s) - y(0)</mrow>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y'')(s)^{5} &amp;= s^2 {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)= s^2 Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0).</mrow>
            </mdn></p>

            <p>Now with no numbers and no alignment.</p>

            <p><md>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y')(s)  = s {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - y(0) = s Y(s) - y(0)</mrow>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y'')(s) = s^2 {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)= s^2 Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0).</mrow>
                <intertext>And so it follows that,</intertext>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y')(s)^{++} = s {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - y(0) = s Y(s) - y(0)</mrow>
                <mrow>{\mathcal L}(y'')(s)^{5} = s^2 {\mathcal L}(y)(s) - sy(0) - y'(0)= s^2 Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0).</mrow>

            <title>Mathematics</title>

            <p>To be able to create both <latex /> and HTML output (plus variations), we rely on MathJax, which in turn supports an extensive subset of the mathematical symbols normally available.  The AMSMath symbol set is a good approximation.  For a complete list, see the <url href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/tex.html#supported-latex-commands">MathJax Supported LaTeX commands</url>.  We load the <c>AMSsymbols</c> library and the library for extensible arrows, <c>extpfeil</c>.</p>

            <p>The following is from the MathJax <url href="http://www.mathjax.org/demos/tex-samples/">demonstration page</url>, an identity due to Ramanujan:<me>\frac{1}{\Bigl(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi\Bigr) e^{\frac25 \pi}} = 1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\ldots} } } }</me></p>

            <p>And again, from the MathJax demonstration page, Maxwell's equations:<md>
                <mrow>\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} -\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t} &amp; = \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}}</mrow>
                <mrow>\nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}} &amp; = 4 \pi \rho</mrow>
                <mrow>\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{E}}\, +\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} &amp; = \vec{\mathbf{0}}</mrow>
                <mrow>\nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{B}} &amp; = 0</mrow>
            </md></p>

                <usage>\nabla</usage>
                <description>gradient operator</description>
            </notation>

            <p>A small test that the extensible arrows library is included properly:<me>A\xmapsto[\text{bijection}]{\Phi+\Psi+\Theta}B</me></p>

            <title>Special, Reserved, and Escape Characters</title>

                <title>Reserved Characters</title>

                <p>One of the goals of MathBook XML is to relieve an author of managing the numerous conflicts when mixing languages that use different characters for special purposes.  But, of course, XML has its own special characters.</p>

                <p>Everybody wants the ampersand, it is the most-dangerous character.  It is <em>the</em> escape character for XML, and <latex /> uses it to organize tables and arrays, and for aligning equations.  Consistently use the element <c>&lt;ampersand /&gt;</c> to make a literal ampersand in normal text, such as in <q>A<ampersand />P.</q>  In mathematics, and other places where you are using <latex /> syntax, use the pre-defined <c>\amp</c> macro.  For code listings and other verbatim text, use the escaped XML entity <c>&amp;amp;</c>.</p>

                <p>The left angle bracket (<c>&lt;</c>) is the second most-dangerous character in your source, since it looks to the XML processor like the start of a new XML element.  The right angle bracket (<c>&gt;</c>) is less dangerous, but for symmetry we treat it the same as the left.  Consistently use the elements <c>&lt;less /&gt;</c> and <c>&lt;greater /&gt;</c> to make left and right angle brackets in normal text.  In mathematics, and other places where you are using <latex /> syntax, use the pre-defined <c>\lt</c> and <c>\gt</c> macros.  For code listings and other verbatim text, use the XML entities <c>&amp;lt;</c> and <c>&amp;gt;</c>.</p>

                <p>Sage defines generators of algebraic structures with a syntax that might remind one of common notation for all <q>combinations</q> of some generators.  It is non-standard Python, but is instead pre-parsed by Sage.  No matter, at issue here is the left angle bracket used to specify generators.  Here is an example, which can be doctested by Sage to verify the example behaves correctly.  Look at the source to see how the generator syntax is created with the XML entities.</p>

                <sage>
                    <input>
                    P.&lt;t&gt; = ZZ[]
                    P
                    </input>
                    <output>Univariate Polynomial Ring in t over Integer Ring</output>
                </sage>

                <p>There is an alternate Sage syntax, which avoids the angle brackets.</p>

                <sage>
                    <input>
                    R = ZZ['u']
                    u = R.gen(0)
                    (u, R)
                    </input>
                    <output>(u, Univariate Polynomial Ring in u over Integer Ring)</output>
                </sage>

                <p>Ampersands and angle brackets are likely to be necessary in source code, such as Sage code (think generators of field extensions) or TikZ code (think arrowheads), and in matrices (think separating entries).  If you have a big matrix, or a huge chunk of TikZ code, you can protect it all at once from the XML processor by wrapping it in <q><c>&lt;![CDATA[</c><nbsp /><nbsp /><nbsp /><c>]]&gt;</c>.</q>  It should be possible to write without ever using the <q>CDATA</q> mechanism, but it might get tedious in places to use the supplied macros or XML entities.</p>

                <p>The other XML reserved characters are the quotation marks, single and double, <c>'</c> and <c>"</c>.  Their use is only constrained in attributes and so do not present a problem elsewhere.  Here are the three XML reserved characters rendered as normal text, see the source to see how they were authored.</p>

                <p><ampersand /><nbsp /><nbsp />
                <less /><nbsp /><nbsp />
                <greater /><nbsp /><nbsp /></p>

                <p>We test the three <latex /> macros for these characters with a pair of aligned equations:<md>
                    <mrow>a^2 + b^2\amp\lt c^2</mrow>
                    <mrow>c^2\amp\gt a^2 + b^2</mrow>
                </md></p>

                <p>So as a summary of how to avoid conflicts with XML's reserved characters:</p>

                <dl>
                    <li>
                        <title><q>Normal</q> Text</title>
                        <p>Use <c>&lt;ampersand /&gt;</c>, <c>&lt;less /&gt;</c>, <c>&lt;greater /&gt;</c>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Mathematics</title>
                        <p>Within <c>m</c>, <c>me</c>, <c>men</c>, and <c>mrow</c> elements, use <c>\amp</c>, <c>\lt</c>, <c>\gt</c>.  Or use <c>CDATA</c> to enclose a large chunk of <latex /> with many of these characters.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Verbatim, Code</title>
                        <p>Within verbatim text (<c>c</c> and <c>pre</c> elements), Sage code, program listings, and console sessions, use the XML entitites <c>&amp;amp;</c>, <c>&amp;lt;</c>, <c>&amp;gt;</c> to get exactly the characters desired.</p>
                    </li>
                </dl>

                <p>It might be instructive to see how the paragraphs above about escape characters were written without inadvertently using an escape character improperly.</p>



                <p>There are a handful of characters that might render just fine in HTML, but <latex /> reserves them for special purposes.  So if they appear unadorned in your source, they will wreak havoc with the <latex /> processing.  And if you escape them with backslashes to migrate to the <latex /> output, then you will see those backslashes in your HTML.  And the backslash is the escape character for Markdown and JSON.  You can't win.  Thus, you need to be aware of these symbols and use the provided MathBook XML elements for each in order to get the right behavior in each type of output.  Here are the outputs, look at the source of this document to see the input elements.</p>

                <title>Pseudo-Characters and Constructions</title>

                <p>There are a few other very common abbreviations of Latin phrases that can be achieved in HTML one way, and in <latex /> with a slightly different mechanism.  These are due to <latex />'s treatment of a period (full stop), depending on its surroundings.  So not reserved characters, but just divergent treatment.  Again, outputs here, see the source for inputs.  Using these will lead to the best quality in all your outputs.  See Will Robertson's informative and arcane <url href="http://latex-alive.tumblr.com/post/827168808/correct-punctuation-spaces">blog post</url> on the topic if you want the full story for the treatment of a full stop in <latex />.</p>

                <p><eg /><nbsp /><nbsp />
                <ie /><nbsp /><nbsp />
                <etc /><nbsp /><nbsp />
                <circa /></p>


                <p>There are a few other characters and marks that get special treatment.  Some do not appear on your keyboard, such as the symbol for copright (and similar business or legal marks in common use).  Then there are some characters that do not appear on your keyboard but frequently a keyboard character is used as a substitute.  For example, a fraction bar and a forward slash (<c>solidus</c> and <c>slash</c>, respectively) have slightly different slopes.  Also, compare a <c>tilde</c> and a <c>swungdash</c>.  You can fake a <c>midpoint</c> in <latex /> by going to math mode, but the midpoint is really a text character. Again, outputs here, see the source for inputs.  Using these uniformly will lead to the best quality in all your outputs, though some of these are very infrequent, or the distinctions are not always that important.</p>

                <title>Quotations</title>

                <p>The <c>q</c> tag will provide beginning and ending double quotations, while the <c>sq</c> tag will behave similarly but provide single quotes.</p>

                <p><q>The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet.</q> (Aristotle)</p>

                <p><sq>It is always wise to look ahead, but difficult to look further than you can see.</sq> (Winston Churchill)</p>

                <p>A large quote can be accomodated with the <c>blockquote</c> tag, which can carry within itself an <c>attribution</c> element.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>The problem with writing a book in verse is, to be successful, it has to sound like you knocked it off on a rainy Friday afternoon. It has to sound easy. When you can do it, it helps tremendously because it's a thing that forces kids to read on. You have this unconsummated feeling if you stop.</p>
                    <attribution>Dr. Seuss</attribution>
                </blockquote>

                <p>We say that again, to test a multiline attribution of a block quotation.  Notice how the dash appears automatically, and that it is a <term>quotation dash</term> in HTML, distinct from other sorts of dashes.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>The problem with writing a book in verse is, to be successful, it has to sound like you knocked it off on a rainy Friday afternoon. It has to sound easy.

                    </attribution>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Sometimes a quote may extend across several paragraphs.  Or a balanced pair of quotations marks crosses an XML boundary, so we need left, right, single and double versions.  (For example, see Section<nbsp /><xref ref="poetry" /> on poetry.)  Here are all four in a haphazard order: <rq />, <lsq />, <lq />, <rsq />.  These should be a last resort, and <em>not</em> a replacement for the <c>q</c> and <c>sq</c> tags.  The left/right versions are used for the following quote from Abraham Lincoln, which we have edited into two paragraphs.</p>

                <p><lq />I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true. I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live by the light that I have.</p>

                <p>I must stand with anybody that stands right, and stand with him while he is right, and part with him when he goes wrong.<rq /></p>

                <p>And as a tests, we try some crazy combinations of quotes, which would normally give <latex /> some trouble where the quotation marks are adjacent.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><q>we use <sq>single quotes inside of double quotes</sq></q></p></li>
                    <li><p><sq><q>double quotes inside of single quotes</q> with more</sq></p></li>
                    <li><p><q><sq>single quotes tight inside of double quotes</sq></q></p></li>
                    <li><p><sq><q>double quotes tight inside of single quotes</q></sq></p></li>
                    <li><p>An <q><sq><sq><q>absurd test</q></sq></sq></q> of two adjacent single quotes inside a pair of double quotes</p></li>
                    <li><p>you would never do this, but a <sq><sq>pair of single quotes</sq></sq></p></li>
                </ul>

                <p><abbr>N.B.</abbr> We have taken no special care to protect against interactions of the actual quote characters (described above) in <latex /> with themselves, or with the grouping tags.</p>
            </subsection>

            <subsection>
                <title>Groupings</title>

                <p>It is possible to make some other groupings like quotations, such as <braces>some <em>emphasized text</em> grouped within braces</braces>, or <brackets>a <booktitle>Book Title</booktitle> inside brackets</brackets>, <angles>some <foreign>foreign words</foreign> inside angle brackets</angles>, or <dblbrackets>just a bit of text within double brackets</dblbrackets>.  Some of these are used extensively by scholars who study texts to note various restorations or deletions.</p>

            <title>Graphics</title>

            <introduction>
                <p>Mathbook XML supports several languages for describing diagrams and pictures with human-readable source code (<ie /> plain text), rather than using a <q>paint</q> program.  Any <latex /> macros used in the rest of your document may be employed in the <latex/>-standalone or Asymptote diagrams (with Sage graphics coming next?).</p>
            </introduction>

            <subsection>
                <title><latex /> images</title>

                <p>There are several graphics engine packages that a <latex /> document can employ. Code from these packages renders diagrams automatically as part of normal processing of <latex /> files.  For HTML output the <c>mbx</c> script produces SVG versions of the pictures.  The script can also produce standalone TEX source files, PDFs, PNGs, and EPSs. The packages should be loaded in <c>docinfo/latex-image-preamble</c>, which is also where global package settings should be made. As mentioned in Subsection <xref ref="subsection-reserved-characters"/>, if any ampersands occur in your <latex /> code you should use the <c>\amp</c> macro. These first examples are from the <url href="http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/">TeXample.net</url> site.</p>

To (successfully) create the gradient shading in the 3D image here, you may need to use <c>pdflatex</c> until <latex /> developers resolve this issue.</p>

                <p>A plot might use a graphics language to draw the axes and grid, but the data might be from an experiment and live in an external file that you do not wish to place in your source.  Place such a file in a subdirectory directly below the directory where your master source file resides.  In the example below <c>data</c> is the directory and <c>hodgkin-huxley-data.dat</c> is the file with the data points.  You <em>must</em> place the file in a subdirectory (it cannot reside next to your source file), but that directory may have subdirectories if you have many such files and want to organize them that way.  Then the <c>--include</c> command-line argument to the <c>mbx</c> script will manage the external files properly as it creates individual image files.</p>

                <p>It is still your responsibility to be sure this directory of external data files follows your <latex /> output to whatever directory you use to convert to a PDF and is in the right location for the relative path given in the XML source.  The discussion above only applies to generating individual image files, such as you would need for the HTML output.</p>

                <p>Figures, tables and side-by-sides that do not have a caption will automatically not receive a number.  So, in particular, a <c>figure</c> element can be used to place a centered <c>image</c>, with vertical breaks.  We interrupt this current list of figures to include a caption-less one, as a check that the numbering continues sequentially.</p>

                <title>Sage Plots</title>

                <p>Any of the numerous capabilities of Sage may be used to produce any graphics object, be it the simple graph of a single-variable function or some realization of a more complicated object.  All of the usual rules about formatting Sage code (esp. indentation) apply, along with one more caveat.  The last line of your Sage code <alert>must</alert> return a Sage <c>Graphics</c> object (or 3D plot).  The <c>mbx</c> script will isolate this last line, use it as the RHS of an assignment statement, and the Sage <c>.save()</c> method will be called to generate the image, which is either a Portable Document Format (PDF) file amenable to <latex /> output, or a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file amenable to HTML output.  For visualizations of 3D plots, Sage will only produce Portable Network Graphics (PNG) files, which can be included in HTML pages or <latex /> output.</p>

                <p>Pay careful attention to the requirement that the last line of your code be a graphics object.  In particular, while <c>show()</c> might appear to do the right thing, it evaluates to Python's <c>None</c> object and that is just what you will get.  The code for Figure<nbsp /><xref ref="figure-sage-double-plot" /> illustrates creating two graphics objects and combining them into an expression on the last line that evaluates to a graphics object.</p>

            <p>In a longer work you might wish to have some references on a per-chapter basis, or similar.  You can make a <q>references</q> subdivision anywhere to hold bibliographic items, and you can reference the items like any other item.  For example, we can cite the article below <xref ref="biblio-beezer-fcla" detail="Chapter R" />, included an indication that a specific chapter may be relevant.</p>

            <title>List Calisthenics</title>

            <subsection>
                <title>Lists, Generally</title>

                <p>This section contains nested lists, to demonstrate how they get assigned labels (numbering, symbols).  But we begin with two simple lists, demonstrating an ordered list and an unordered list.  Se the end of section for an example of a description list.  Since Jupyter notebooks use markdown syntax, their lists are less flexible.  So some assertions here may be wrong when viewed as a Jupyter notebook.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><p>First.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Second.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Third.</p></li>
                </ol>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>Red</p></li>
                    <li><p>Green</p></li>
                    <li><p>Yellow</p></li>
                    <li><p>Purple</p></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Next, we have a list with no customization and multiple levels to test the defaults.  <latex /> allows a maximum of four levels of ordered/numbered lists, and a total of six levels if some unordered lists are mixed in.  The second-level defaults (lower-case Latin) are formatted slightly different in <latex /> versus HTML.  The HTML style is not easy to adjust, but you can  specify the <latex /> version to match if it is important.  The default order of the labels in Markdown/Jupyter (Arabic, Latin, latin, roman) is different than for <latex /> and HTML (Arabic, latin, roman, Latin), so cross-references are not correct.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><p>Level 1, first.</p></li>
                    <li xml:id="list-two">
                        <p>Level 1, second.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><p>Level 2, first.</p></li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Level 2, second.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><p>Level 3, first.</p></li>
                                    <li xml:id="list-two-two-two">
                                        <p>Level 3, second.</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li><p>Level 4, first.</p></li>
                                            <li><p>Level 4, second.</p></li>
                                            <li xml:id="list-two-two-two-three"><p>Level 4, third.</p></li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><p>Level 3, third.</p></li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        <li><p>Level 2, third.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Level 1, third.</p></li>
                </ol>

                <p>Items in ordered lists may be be give an <c>xml:id</c> and then may be the target of an <c>xref</c>.  We test three here, referencing down into the hierarchy above.  Level 1, second: <xref ref="list-two" />.  Level 3, second: <xref ref="list-two-two-two" />.  Level 4, third: <xref ref="list-two-two-two-three" />.</p>

                <p>And now a four-level deep unordered list with the default labels supplied by MBX (disc, circle, square, disc).  Again, the defalt order for Markdown/Jupyter (disc, square, circle, circle) is different than for <latex /> and HTML (disc, circle, square, disc)</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>Level 1, first.</p></li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Level 1, second.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Level 2, first.</p></li>
                            <li>

                                        <ul>

                                            <li><p>Level 4, second.</p></li>
                                            <li><p>Level 4, third.</p></li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><p>Level 3, third.</p></li>

                </ul>

                <p>And a total of six levels with a mix of ordered and unordered lists, the most that out-of-the-box-<latex /> is able to handle.</p>

                <p>Now, nested lists with the defaults replaced by custom choices.  First, an ordered list, three deep, upper Roman numerals, then upper-case Latin, then more traditional Arabic numerals on the three elements of the third level.  Note the adornments of the labels will be rendered in LaTeX, but not in HTML, and the label specifications have no effect in a Jupyter notebook.</p>

                <p>Exercises and References are specialized subdivisions you can put anywhere.  They are implemented as top-level lists, so should share behavior.  For example, an exercise may have many parts and when expressed as a list, should have the expected labels.</p>

                <p>Similarly, References may have lists in their annotations.  Unlikely?  But possible.</p>

                <p>The next two subdivisions are an Exercises subdivision and a References subdivision, which have lists within an exercise and a bibliographic item (respectively).</p>

                <p>A <q>description</q> list has a short term or phrase that is prominent, followed by a short description.  It is modeled on the lists of similar structure in both <latex /> and HTML.  It makes for a nice medium-weight way to define terms, somewhere in-between the <c>term</c> tag which just makes a term prominent in a sentence, and a <c>definition</c>, which is set off, has a heading, a number, and a title.  This example is from Bob Plantz.</p>

                <p>A list can be wrapped with a <c>&lt;list&gt;</c> element, so that it earns a number, can be given a title and have an introduction and conclusion.  Cross-references to individual list items get a bit absurd as they are prefixed with the number of the list and then the number of the item, so conceivably you could get a number like <c>4.5.3:2.a.ii</c>.</p>

                        <p>Because the colors are always in the same order, an ordered list is natural here.  The colors change continuously, but are often divided up into large ranges that human perception can easily distinguish.</p>

            <p>A very minimal table, hence with left-justified cells, no borders.  We do wrap the tabular element in a table element to get centering, numbering and a caption.</p>

            <p>Tables can be used many ways.  We describe long division of polynomials by using vertical and horizontal borders on individual entries of a table.  The division lines are slightly thicker than the subtraction lines.  This is a good example of the typical abuse of tables for horizontal and vertical layout.  Also indicative of this abuse is that it might make more sense to call this a <q>Figure,</q> not a <q>Table</q>.</p>

            <p>The next table describes how to construct tables via the <c>tabular</c> element.  The <c>table</c> element may be used to enclose the raw table, so as to associate a caption and get vertical separation with horizontal centering.</p>

            <p>The <c>tabular</c> element contains a sequence of <c>row</c> elements, and must contain at least one.  Each <c>row</c> contains a sequence of <c>cell</c> elements and must have the same number in each row (acccounting for the use of the <c>colspan</c> attribute).  The contents of the <c>cell</c> elements are the text to appear in entries of the table.</p>

            <p>A sequence of <c>col</c> elements may optionally be used.  But if one appears, then there must be the right number for the width of the table.  They are empty elements always, and just carry information about their respective column.</p>

            <p>Where the body of the table below has an entry, it means the attribute may be used on the element, and affects the range of the tabular described by the element.  Employment of an attribute on elements to the right in the table will supersede use on elements to the left.  Generally, every cell has right and bottom borders, but only cells at the left side of the table have a left border and only cells across the top have a top border.  Only one cell has four borders.</p>

                <p>One of the goals of MathBook XML is to gently guide authors towards good choices in the design of their documents, even if we do not claim to know it all ourselves.  Take a close look at that table about tables.  What's missing?  No vertical rules.  Try living without them, you will not really miss them.  If you think you need to divide a table into two halves, maybe you really need two tables (and then see the <q>side-by-side</q> capabilities, Section <xref ref="section-side-by-side" />).</p>

                <p>In the documentation for his excellent <latex /> package, <url href="https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs">booktabs</url>, Simon Fear gives two rules for what he calls <q>formal tables</q>: (1) Never, ever use vertical rules, and (2) Never use double rules.  We have resisted the temptation to enforce the former and have provided an alternative to the second (three thicknesses).  He refers to using tables for layout as creating <q>tableau.</q>  If you are finicky about the look of your work, the first three pages of the documentation is recommended reading.</p>

                <p>That all said, we now give several examples in order to stress and demonstrate our code.</p>

            <p>Figures, tables and side-by-sides that do not have a caption will automatically not receive a number.  So, in particular, a <c>table</c> element can be used to place a centered <c>tabular</c>, with vertical breaks.  We interrupt this current list of tables to include a caption-less one, as a check that the numbering continues sequentially and as a check of a minimal example of a table, testing edge and corner cases.</p>

            <table xml:id="table-captionless-titleless-minimal">
                <tabular top="medium"><row bottom="medium" left="minor"><cell right="minor">One</cell></row></tabular>

            <p>Same example as before, but now with vertical rules.  See the source for comments.</p>

               <p>This example tests several things.  In <latex /> output, figures, tables, listings and side-by-sides are <q>floats</q> whose placement can migrate, but we have tries to supress this behavior.  However, a float that is the first item of an <q>environment</q> (like a theorem or an example) can still float to a position <em>before</em> its title.  If that does not happen here, then our additional defenses are working.</p>

               <p>This example also checks that the total number of columns is correctly computed from the first row, which features several <c>colspan</c> attributes.</p>
           </example>

            <p>A bare minimum table (one row with one cell) to test edge cases:</p>

                </tabular>
            </table>

            <p>Table cells can have multiline content using <tag>line</tag> elements. This is not the same thing as a paragraph cell<mdash />line breaking will happen precisely where the author tells it to. A line will not break, even on a narrow screen. If a cell uses a <tag>line</tag>, it must only use a sequence of <tag>line</tag>s and no other content. This is also a good time to demonstrate the <attribute>valign</attribute> attribute.</p>

            <title>Embedded Interactive Elements</title>

            <introduction>
                <p>When outputting Web page versions, it is possible to embed a variety of dynamic interactive elements.  In a <latex />/PDF version, these will necessarily need to be replaced by some static substitute, such as a screenshot.  See Section<nbsp /><xref ref="section-sage-cells" /> for the specifics of embedding instances of the Sage Cell Server.</p>
            </introduction>

            <subsection>
                <title>GeoGebra</title>

                <p>This first example of a  GeoGebra demonstration has just the controls for moving the three vertices on the circumfrence of the circle.  This is courtesy of Danny Parsons at the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences.  This demo requires Java, which could be problematic.</p>

                <p>GeoGebra will create screenshots of demonstrations in TikZ/<latex /> code.  For a static version, we use this as a figure.</p>

               <!-- 1. Build a GeoGebra applet                            -->
               <!-- 2. Save it as an HTML page                            -->
               <!-- 3. Open the HTML and find the Base64 encoded version  -->
               <!-- 4. Copy (with no line breaks!) into ggbBase64 element -->

                <p>With a totally empty <q>geogebra</q> element, you will get a blank slate to play around in.   This is based on an example of embedding GeoGebra into Sage notebooks by Bruce Cohen.  Notice the full suite of menus and tools (in contrast to the previous example).</p>

                <p>Again, this example will run with Java.  GeoGebra demonstrations can be run via HTML5 without invoking Java, but this seems to only be possible in the Chrome browser.  Support will be expanded, especially if requested.</p>

Support is limited to WebM format initially, mp4 support will be easy to add.  This may require an HTML5 capable browser, such as Chrome, to render properly.</p>

            <p>YouTube videos may be embedded with only knowledge of the <q>ID</q>.  This a string of eleven seemingly random characters that show up in the URL when you watch a video.  For the Led Zeppelin performance below, the ID is <c>hAzdgU_kpGo</c>, which you might normally watch directly from the URL <url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAzdgU_kpGo" />.  Screen real estate is determined by specifying an optional <c>@width</c> attribute as a percentage, and aspect ratio is preserved on the assumption of HD video (16:9).</p>

            <p>Enhancements could include other aspect ratios, and attributes for a start and stop time.</p>

            <p>These may be placed <q>standalone</q> but are designed mostly on the assumption that they are wrapped in a <c>figure</c> with a <c>title</c> (which is distinct from a <c>caption</c>).</p>

            <title>Exercises</title>

            <introduction>
                <p>Exercises in an <q>exercises</q> section are numbered automatically.  However, what if you have a busted problem and remove it?  Then a bunch of problem numbers change and your list of homework for your students changes as well.  What a mess.  Use auto-numbering while writing and refining.  Once stable, go ahead and hard-code problem numbers as you delete/add.  Notice the oddly numbered problem below.  Once you go down this road, you can't stop.  But instructors will thank you for it.</p>

                <p>More precisely, once you hard-code a number for a problem, you will likely need to hard-code every subsequent problem number in that section of exercises.  This is because the automatic numbering is unlikely to be what you really want, or what you had before.</p>
            </introduction>

            <exercise>
                <title>An Exercise in a Section</title>
                <statement>
                    <p>Exercises can appear in a <q>section</q> of their own.  You need to give the section a title, even if it seems obvious what to call it.  Individual exercises may have titles, as you choose.  Problem: How should we hide solutions?</p>
                </statement>
                <solution>
                    <p>Maybe a global switch should be used to suppress solutions, while a separate processing regime could use them as part of a solutions manual.</p>

        Various author tools are planned.  Note the embedded "todo"
        elements above.  An XSL transform in-testing will extract them
        for a report, and they are hidden in actual output.
        For a cross-reference, instead of a "ref" atrribute,
        you can use a "provisional" attribute while writing, which is
        especially useful for unknown forward references.  This is
        included in the author report also.
        A "preview" XSL transform to HTML could be especially useful.

        <section xml:id="section-cross-referencing">
            <title>Cross-Referencing</title>

            <p>Cross-references are easy, since that is a key reason for having a highly structured document.  Here is a useful feature if you elect to use it.  Any <c>&lt;xref&gt;</c> will <q>know</q> what it points to, so you can let it provide the <q>naming</q> part of the cross-reference text.  You can turn this on globally with the command-line parameter <c>autoname</c> set to <c>'yes'</c>.  If you do that, you will see most of the names in this document doubled, since the names are written into the source already in most places outside of this section.  Try it and see: use <c>--stringparam autoname 'yes'</c> as an argument to <c>xsltproc</c>.</p>

            <p>Moreover, the names themselves will change with the use of the one language dependent file.  And another bonus is that with an autoname, you automatically get a <em>non-breaking</em> space between the name and the reference.  The autoname switch makes no sense for <q>provisional</q> cross-references, since there is no information about what they point to.</p>

            <p>Here is a reference that has no indication of its type in the source:  <xref ref="theorem-FTC" />.  So by default you will just see a number that you can click on.  If you use the <c>autoname="yes"</c> switch then you should see <q>Theorem</q> prepended.  Note that if you changed the theorem to a lemma, then that change would be reflected here automatically when autonaming is in effect.</p>

            <p>If you set the autonaming behavior globally, or accept the default behavior, there will still be instances where you want to override that choice.  Simple: just say <c>autoname="yes"</c> or <c>autoname="no"</c> as part of the <c>xref</c>.  Each example below should look the same each time this article is processed, no matter how the global <c>autoname</c> is set.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>No name ever: <xref ref="corollary-FTC-derivative" autoname="no" /></p></li>
                <li><p>Always named: <xref ref="corollary-FTC-derivative" autoname="yes" /></p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>You might also wish to provide a prefix to a cross-reference and have it incorporated into the text of what you would click on in an electronic version.  So if you make an <c>xref</c> with some content, then that content will prefix the cross-reference within the clickable/pokeable text and be attached with a non-breaking space.  This <c>xref</c> content totally overrides any prefix that might happen otherwise.  So the name of an item (<eg /> <q>corollary</q>) could be replaced, and if you make a cross-reference with a title as the clickable, then that text can be replaced also.  An example:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>A grand result: <xref ref="corollary-FTC-derivative">Major Corollary</xref></p></li>
                <li><p>A grand result: <xref ref="corollary-FTC-derivative" autoname="title">a nice corollary</xref></p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Suppose you want to reference two theorems, so you might want to say something like <q>Theorems 4.6 and 5.2.</q>  With global autonaming on, you can override the first <c>Theorem</c> by providing the content <c>Theorems</c> on the first <c>xref</c> and <c>autoname="no"</c> on the second <c>xref</c>.  (With global autonaming off, you will also get what you want/expect.)   Here is the test, which should look correct no matter what the global switch is:  <xref ref="section-cross-referencing">Sections</xref> and <xref ref="section-internationalization" autoname="no" />.  (But notice that it is up to you to be certain the types of these targets do not change without you changing the content of the first <c>xref</c>.  The <q>author-tools</q> mode and careful choices of <c>xml:id</c> strings can help avoid this trap.)</p>

            <p>One final twist.  If you say <c>autoname="title"</c>, then the title you assigned to the theorem will prefix the number.  Here is a the final example, which should always refer to a fundamental theorem by name <xref ref="theorem-FTC" autoname="title" />.</p>

            <p>Cross-references to exercises with hard-coded numbers should respect the supplied number.  Exercise<nbsp /><xref ref="exercise-with-hardcoded-number" /> should reference problem 42a.</p>

            <p>Here we form a list to test pointing at various structures.  Each of the following should open a knowl in the HTML version, otherwise it will be a traditional hyperlink (if possible).  Note that if a knowl opens, there will always be an <q>in-context</q> link which will take you to the actual location, should you have  wished instead to just go there.</p>

            <p>Cross-references to structural elements of the document will always take you there directly, since even in the HTML version these parts never get realized as knowls.  You will find such links sprinkled through this document, but here is an autonamed link to a subsubsection:  <xref ref="subsubsection-different-integrals" autoname="yes" />.</p>

            <p>Cross-references can be built into display mathematics, but they can only point to one item (<ie /> a comma-delimited list of targets is not supported).  Examples below should test the distinction in HTML output between a link that opens a knowl and a link that jumps to a larger chunk of content.  Notice that display mathematics is entirely <latex /> syntax, no matter which output format you create.  So if you do not use the <c>autoname</c> facility, you need to wrap non-math text in <c>\text{}</c> and perhaps use a tilde (<c>~</c>) as a non-breaking space (examine the source of this article).</p>

            <p><md>
                <mrow>x^2 + y^2 &amp;= z^2&amp;&amp;<xref ref="theorem-FTC" autoname="yes" /></mrow>
                <mrow>a^2 + b^2 &amp;= c^2&amp;&amp;\text{Section}~<xref ref="section-fundamental-theorem" /></mrow>
            </md></p>

            <p>Variations on the above include multiple <c>xml:id</c> as the value of a single <c>ref</c> attribute on an <c>xref</c>, in the form of a comma-separated list.  In this case, only the numbers are links/knowls and the autonaming attribute is based on the type of the first <c>ref</c>.  Wrapping with brackets (citations) or parentheses (equations) is also controlled by the type of the first <c>ref</c>.  And the <c>detail</c> attribute for a bibliographic reference is silently ignored.  So you can do silly things like have a reference to a theorem within a list of equation numbers and there will be no error message.  Handle with care.  Spaces after commas in the list will migrate to the output as spaces, so if you don't have any, you won't get any.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>Three theorems, with spaces, autonamed: <xref ref="theorem-FTC, theorem-number-01, theorem-number-03" autoname="yes"/></p></li>
                <li><p>Two equations, no spaces, autonamed: <xref ref="equation-alternate-FTC,equation-use-FTC" autoname="yes"/></p></li>
                <li><p>Two bibliographic items, no autoname: <xref ref="biblio-judson-AATA, biblio-lay-article" /></p></li>
                <!-- <li><p>: <xref ref="" /></p></li> -->
            </ul>

            <p>If you have a long list of items (such as homework exercises, not in an <c>exercisegroup</c>, or perhaps several chapters, you can get a cross-reference that prints as a range by using <c>xref</c> with two attributes <c>first</c> and <c>last</c>, which may contain a single <c>xml:id</c> each.  As with multiple references, <c>first</c> will control autonaming and other features.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>A range of exercises, autonamed: <xref first="exercise-test-number" last="exercise-essay" autoname="yes"/></p></li>
                <li><p>A range of equations: <xref first="equation-alternate-FTC" last="equation-use-FTC" /></p></li>
                <li><p>A system of equations, given as range from first to last: <xref first="equation-system-begin" last="equation-system-end" /></p></li>
                <li><p>A range of sections, hand-named to be plural: Sections<nbsp /><xref first="section-sage-cells" last="section-cross-referencing" /></p></li>
                <li><p>A range of bibliographic items: <xref first="biblio-judson-AATA" last="biblio-lay-article" /></p></li>
                <!-- <li><p>: <xref ref="" /></p></li> -->
            </ul>

            <title>Pre-Formatted Text</title>

            <p>In Sage, if you wanted to build a matrix, then you would use the <c>matrix()</c> constructor.  Here is the matrix of second partials of <m>f(x,y)=x^3+8x^2y^3 + y^4</m>, as you would enter it in Sage.  Notice that <c>SR</c> is the ring of symbolic expressions, <c>Symbolic Ring</c>.</p>

            <pre>
            var('x', 'y')
            J = matrix(SR, [
                [6*x + 16*y^3, 48*x*y^2],
                [48*x*y^2, 48*x^2*y + 12*y^2]
                ])
            </pre>

            <p>That accomplished, Sage will easily and naturally provide a <latex /> representation of the matrix with the command <c>latex(J)</c>.</p>

            <pre>
            \left(\begin{array}{rr}

            <p>The realization of preformatted text should be robust enough that it can be cut from documents and pasted without any substitutions of <q>fancier</q> Unicode characters for generic ASCII characters.  Try the <q>minus</q> sign on the <m>48</m> above to see if it does not become a dash, or the single quotes on the Sage variables.</p>

            <p>For Sage input code, the first non-whitespace character sets the left margin, since legitimate Python code has no subsequent lines outdented.  For pre-formatted code, the line with the <em>least</em> whitespace leading the line will determine the left margin.  If preserving indentation is important, do not mix spaces and tabs.  For syntax highlighting of text representing computer programs, or parts of them, see Section<nbsp /><xref ref="section-programs" />.  Examine the source of the following example to help understand this paragraph.</p>

            <pre>
            A normal line
                    An indented line
    An outdented line
            </pre>

            <p>The <c>&lt;c&gt;</c> element, for inline code snippets (or anything else in a monospace font) uses the question-mark character to tell <latex /> where the text begins and ends.  This will be a problem if the text has a question mark in it!  So there is the attribute <c>latexsep</c> that allows you to specify another character that does not appear in your text.  For example, XML directives use question-marks now and then, so writing about them in MathBook XML requires specifying a different separation character, as in:  <c latexsep="!">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt;</c>.  The <c>&lt;pre&gt;</c> element does not suffer from this quirk.</p>

            <p>Snippets should also be robust for cut/paste operations.  For example, you should not get <q>curly</q> <q>smart</q> quote marks in verbatim text: <c>this should have "dumb" quote marks</c>. Here are a few characters that should migrate through <latex /> to a PDF unmolested:  <c>'"----"'</c></p>

            <p><c>If you write a very long snippet of inline code it can impinge on the right margin, especially if it were to begin close to that margin.  For output in LaTeX we allow line-breaking, but we do not get hyphenation and the font is fixed-width.  So not always perfect.  Consider a display (program listing as above with the pre element) or maybe reorganizing a sentence.  And it looks like a space after that left parenthesis just got ignored in the PDF created from the latex output.</c></p>

            <p>An intermediate type of verbatim text can be accomplished with the <c>&lt;cd&gt;</c> tag, short for <q>code display.</q>  It allows for larger chunks of verbatim text to show up in the middle of a paragraph, but with some vertical space above and below.  It can be<cd>authored as a single line</cd>or if you wish to have multiple lines<cd>
                <cline>there is the cline tag</cline>
                <cline>meant to model the line tag</cline>
                <cline>and short for "code line"</cline>
            </cd>and you may even<cd>
                <cline>use a single cline</cline>
            </cd>if you like to have your source closely model the visual look of the output.</p>

            <p>The <c>&lt;pre&gt;</c> tag is meant for use outside of paragraphs, but is otherwise very similar.  The source may also be structured as a sequence of <c>&lt;cline&gt;</c> as in the next example, recycling content from above.</p>

            <pre>
                <cline>If you write a very long snippet of inline </cline>
                <cline>code it can impinge on the right margin,</cline>

            <p>Sage cells can be used for Python examples, but Sage uses a mild amount of pre-parsing, so that might not be a wise decision, especially in instructional settings.  We might implement Skulpt or Brython (in-browser Python) or the Python language argument to the Sage Cell Server.  To see examples of authoring Sage cells, have a look at Section<nbsp /><xref ref="section-sage-cells" />.</p>

            <p>In the meantime, program listings, especially with syntax highlighting, is useful all by itself.  The <q>R</q> language might not be a bad stand-in for pseudo-code, as it supports assignment with a left arrow and has fairly generic procedural syntax for control structures and data structures.  Or maybe Pascal would be a good choice?  Here is an example of R.  Note in the source that the entire block of code is wrapped in a CDATA section due to the four left angle brackets.</p>

            <p>If you are discussing algorithms in the abstract (or even concretely), you can set them off like a theorem, with a number, a title and a target for cross-references.  Sometimes you claim an algorithm produces something in particular, or has certain properties, such as a theoretical run time, so a proof may be included.  See the discussion just preceding about (limited) options for pseudo-code.</p>

            <algorithm xml:id="algorithm-sieve-eratosthenes">
                <title>Sieve of Eratosthenes</title>
                <statement>
                    <p>On input of a positive integer <c>n</c> this algorithm will compute all the prime numbers up to, and including, <c>n</c>.  It was named for Eratosthenes of Cyrene (<circa /> 276 BC<ndash /><circa /> 195/194 BC) by Nicomachus (<circa /> 60<ndash /><circa /> 120 CE) in <booktitle>Introduction to Arithmetic</booktitle>.

                                <li><p>If <c>p</c> is now the last element of the list, stop</p></li>

                </statement>

                <proof>
                    <p>Any element removed is a non-trivial product of two integers and hence composite.  So no prime is is ever removed from the list.</p>

                    <p>Each composite number is a multiple of some prime, and since no prime is ever removed, each composite will be removed.  Hence the removed elements are precisely the set of composite numbers in the list and thus the remainder are precisely the primes on the list.</p>
                </proof>
            </algorithm>

            <p>If you are writing about system-level software, you may need to write numbers in hexadecimal or binary.  Here we use a numbered, displayed equation (mathematics) and <latex /> macros such as <c>\texttt</c> for a monospace text font, and <c>\;</c> for spacing/grouping the bits of the binary number. <men>\texttt{6C2A}_{16} = \texttt{0110}\;\texttt{1100}\;\texttt{0010}\;\texttt{1010}_{2}</men>  If you use these constructions repeatedly, then some <latex /> macros might be useful.  It might also be beneficial for us to add some MathBook XML markup for such numbers used in a paragraph<mdash />send us a feature request.</p>

            <p>A specialized version of a program listing is an interactive command/response session at a command-line, where differing fonts are used to differentiate the system prompt, the user's commands, and the system's reaction.  A   <c>console</c> session may be used by itself, or it can be wrapped in a listing to get a number and a caption.  As elsewhere, you will need to escape ampersands and angle brackets (such as if you have a command using redirection), using <c>&amp;amp;</c>, <c>&amp;lt;</c>, and <c>&amp;gt;</c> in your source.  </p>

            <listing xml:id="console-raspberry-pi">
                <caption>Console Session: <c>int</c> and <c>float</c></caption>
                <console>
                    <prompt>pi@raspberrypi ~/progs/chap02 $ </prompt>
                    <input>gcc -Wall -o intAndFloat intAndFloat.c</input>
                    <prompt>pi@raspberrypi ~/progs/chap02 $ </prompt>
                    <input>./intAndFloat</input>
                    <output>
                    The integer is 19088743 and the float is 19088.742188
                    </output>
                    <prompt>pi@raspberrypi ~/progs/chap02 $ </prompt>
                    <input />
                </console>
            </listing>

            <p>Notice in the HTML version of the above example that when you highlight all, or a portion, of the listing for a cut<ampersand />paste that the prompts are not included.</p>

            <p>There is one subtlety with a <c>console</c> session rendered as <latex /> output.  The user input is made bold by a <latex /> macro, which means that your code cannot contain the special <latex /> characters <q><backslash /></q>, <q><lbrace /></q>, and <q><rbrace /></q>, which are used to begin a macro, begin a group, and end a group (respectively).  You will get an error message if this condition exists, and there are parameters <c>latex.console.macro-char</c>, <c>latex.console.begin-char</c>, and <c>latex.console.end-char</c> that will allow you to specify alternatives (which need to be characters that do not appear in <em>any</em> of your console sessions, document-wide).  The characters <c>&amp; % $ # _ { } ~ ^ \</c> have special meaning in <latex /> but should be available for duty as these alternative characters (though not all have been tested).  The backslash used in pathnames for Windows is a highly likely case where this needs adjustment.</p>

            <!-- & % $ # _ { } ~ ^ \ Add @ to this list as it is implemented, but need empty element to render it?-->

            <p>There is no good way to provide an example of this situation, without making a document with an error in it, out-of-the-box.  So experiment by using <c>--stringparam</c> on the <c>xsltproc</c> command-line with alternative characters that will behave with the example above, and with characters that will cause the example above to raise errors.  In practice, you may want to specify alternative characters in a thin XSL extension file specific to your project.</p>

            <title>Units of Measure</title>

            <p>Units of measure can be given xml treatment too with the <c>quantity</c> element. In <latex />, the <c>siunitx</c> package is loaded to achive unit handling. Since that package only offers SI units, some other common units will be added by MBX in the preamble. In HTML, the capabilities of <c>siunitx</c> are simulated, weakly. Note that at present, you should not attempt to use the <c>quantity</c> element within a math environment.</p>
            <p>The value of gravitational constant <m>g</m> is <quantity><mag>9.8</mag><unit base="meter"/><per base="second" exp="2"/></quantity>. Force is measured in <quantity><unit prefix="kilo" base="gram"/><unit base="meter"/><per base="second" exp="2"/></quantity>, also known as one <quantity><unit base="newton"/></quantity>. A quantity with rather ridiculous units is <quantity><mag>23</mag><unit prefix='micro' base='hectare' exp='23'/><per base='degreeCelsius'/><per base='second' exp='2'/></quantity>. One <quantity><unit base="hertz"/></quantity> is the same as <quantity><per base='second'/></quantity>. You can have a unitless quantity, like <quantity><mag>42</mag></quantity>, which may help with consistency between such numbers and units in the <latex /> output. Some non-SI units are available, such as the absurd <quantity><unit base="degreeFahrenheit"/><unit base="foot"/><unit base="pound"/><per base="gallon"/></quantity>.  The <latex /> command <c>\pi</c> is recognized within <c>mag</c> in conversions to HTML, which is consistent with the behavior with a conversion to <latex />, for example there are <quantity><mag>2\pi</mag><unit base="radian"/></quantity> in a full circle.</p>

            <p>For a full list of the allowed units and prefixes, see <c>mathbook-units.xsl</c>. If you have a need for more units, they need to be added to <c>mathbook-units.xsl</c> in the section that deals with units which are not part of <c>siunitx</c> by default.  Note that the <c>mag</c> element should come first, followed by the <c>unit</c> element, followed by the <c>per</c> element.</p>

              <p>A variety of different objects can be put side-by-side using the <c>sidebyside</c> element.  Specifically, <c>figure</c>, <c>table</c>, <c>paragraphs</c>, <c>image</c>, <c>tabular</c>, <c>p</c>.  The first three have some structure, the second three are atomic.  For HTML output, the entire <c>sidebyside</c> will be a knowl as a target of a cross reference, and may be born within a knowl (via the <c>html.knowl.sidebyside</c> switch).  Figures and tables (only) from within a side-by-side will be realized as knowls when the target of a cross-reference, but are never born as knowls within a side-by-side.</p>

                <title>Figures with Numbers Side-By-Side</title>

                <p>Figures can be put side-by-side using the <c>sidebyside</c> element; if a <q>global</q> caption is present, then the figures will be labelled as (a), (b), (c), etc; for example, see the subfigures in <xref ref="fig-sidebyside-global" autoname="yes"/>. You can, of course, reference the subfigures individually, for example: <xref ref="fig-sidebyside-subfigure" autoname="yes"/>.</p>

                <p>If a global caption is <em>not</em> present, then the figures will be labeled regularly, as for example, <xref ref="regular-figure" autoname="yes"/> and <xref ref="another-regular-figure" autoname="yes"/></p>

                <p>The <c>width</c> can be specified for each child, or omitted, in which case it will be calculated automatically based on the <em>remaining</em> width available; for finer control, it is generally best to specify the width.</p>

                <title>Images Without Captions</title>

                <p>We can use the <c>sidebyside</c> element to put <c>images</c> next to each other; there's no need to specify the <c>width</c>, unless you want to fine tune things.</p>

                </sidebyside>

                <p>Now we fine-tune with different widths (which add up to 100<percent />).</p>

            <title>Advanced Numbering</title>

            <introduction>
                <p>This section demonstrates the numbering patterns used throughout MathBook XML.  There are five subsections.  Two intermediate subsections each have two subsubsections.  This creates a total of seven divisions that are leaves of the document tree.  In each leaf we have placed two numbered theorems, for a total of fourteen.  There is no real content, this is just a demonstration.</p>

                <p>Use values of <c>0</c> through <c>3</c> for the <c>numbering.theorems.level</c> parameter to see how these numbers change accordingly.  It is easiest to compare if you use <c>chunk.level &lt; 2</c> so the theorems all land on the same page if you are previewing in HTML.</p>

                <conclusion>
                    <p>Conclusion now.  We include two theorems as numbered items in the conclusion to test their numbers, which are sometimes totally illogical and are inconsistent across output formats.  To see the effect, use <c>--stringparam numbering.theorems.level 3</c> in the <c>xsltproc</c> invocation. See this GitHub <url href="https://github.com/rbeezer/mathbook/issues/139">issue</url> for details.</p>

                <title>Theorems in This Section</title>

                <p>We have a lot of theorems in this section, so we illustrate including an automatic list of these here.  We use the <c>elements</c> attribute to limit the list to <c>theorem</c> elements, and we use the <c>scope</c> attribute to limit the list to this <c>section</c>.  You can use an introductory <c>p</c> like this one, or not.  The list gets no title or visual separation, so use the usual subdivision elements to make that happen.  The <c>elements</c> attribute can be a space-delimited list of many different elements.  This list should not include the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Theorem<nbsp /><xref ref="theorem-FTC" />.  See a slightly different example in <xref ref="appendix-results" autoname="yes" />.</p>

                <title>Renaming Document Parts</title>

                <p><q>Names</q> for various parts of a document are determined exactly once for each language, ensuring consistency and saving you the bother of always typing them in.</p>

                <p>However, you may want to have <q>Conundrum</q>s in your document and you have no use for any <q>Proposition</q>s.  So you can repurpose the <c>proposition</c> tag to render a different name.  Or you might have a Lab Manual and want to rename <c>subsection</c> as <q>Activity</q>.  See the <c>docinfo</c> portion of this sample article to see how this is done, in concert with the example below.</p>

                <proposition xml:id="proposition-as-conundrum">
                    <statement>
                        <p>Aah, this <em>is</em> confusing!</p>
                    </statement>
                </proposition>

                    <p>If you are renaming many parts of your document, then you may not understand the design philosophy of MathBook XML.  In particular, you should not be doing a wholesale shuffle of <c>part</c>, <c>chapter</c>, <c>section</c>, <etc />  This feature is intended for very limited use and is <em>not considered best practice</em>.</p>

                    <p>This feature could also be abused to provide a comprehensive suite of translations into a language not yet supported.  If so, please contact us about moving your translations into MathBook XML for the benefit of all.  Thanks.</p>

                <title>List of Results</title>

                <p>We had an automatic list of theorems for just one section, back in <xref ref="subsection-local-theorems" autoname="yes" />.  Here we expand to include <c>corollary</c> in our space-delimited list of <c>elements</c> and we request <c>divisions</c> (headings) at each <c>subsection</c> and <c>section</c>.  The default <c>scope</c> is the entire document, which is appropriate here in the backmatter.  There are many subsections with no results, so we set the <c>empty</c> attribute to <c>no</c> to suppress them, though this is the default behavior (<c>yes</c> being the other option to see divisions with no list items).  These lists are most valuable if you are in the practice of giving items titles.</p>

                <conclusion>
                    <p>There is an index manufactured in the next subdivision (so we are talking about here), which contains just a few sample entries.  Look at the source of this XML file, searching on <c>&gt;index&lt;</c>, to see how they are written.  They may be placed inside of a a variety of structures, and their location greatly influences the cross-references produced in the HTML version of the index.</p>

                    <p>The <latex /> version of the index is more traditional, using page numbers to reference locations.  A newer package is used to create the index, and so there is no extra intermediate step required to process the index.  The one downside of this convenience is that index entries may not be placed in the back colophon (which is the only subdivision that may follow the index).</p>

                    <p>There is an index entry about multicolumn lists which spans more than one page.  This requires doubly-linked index entries, the first has the index content and points to the <c>xml:id</c> of the second.  The second is an empty element, but points back to the <c>xml:id</c> of the first entry.  So each has a marker and a reference, which allows the span of the index topic to cut across XML boundaries in the source.  This is the mechanism to produce a page range in the <latex /> index.  See the source of this article for syntax details.</p>
