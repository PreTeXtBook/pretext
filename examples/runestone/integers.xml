    <title>The Integers</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>The integers are the building blocks of mathematics. In this chapter we will investigate  the fundamental properties of the integers, including mathematical induction, the division algorithm, and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.</p>
    </introduction>

        <title>Mathematical Induction</title>

        <p>Suppose we wish to show that
            <me>1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}</me>
        for any natural number <m>n</m>. This formula is easily  verified for small numbers such as <m>n = 1</m>, 2, 3, or 4, but it is impossible to verify for all natural numbers on a case-by-case basis.  To prove the formula true in general, a more generic method is required.</p>

        <p>Suppose we have verified the equation for the first <m>n</m> cases.  We will attempt to show that we can generate the formula for the <m>(n + 1)</m>th case from this knowledge.  The formula is true for <m>n = 1</m> since 
            <me>1 = \frac{1(1 + 1)}{2}.</me>
        If we have verified the first <m>n</m> cases, then<md>
            <mrow>1 + 2 + \cdots + n + (n + 1) &amp; = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + n + 1</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = \frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2}</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = \frac{(n + 1)[(n + 1) + 1]}{2}.</mrow>
        </md></p>

        <p>This is exactly the formula for the <m>(n + 1)</m>th case.</p>

        <p>This method of proof is known as <term>mathematical induction</term>.  Instead of attempting to verify a statement about some subset <m>S</m> of the positive integers <m>{\mathbb N}</m> on a case-by-case basis, an impossible task if <m>S</m> is an infinite set, we give a specific proof for the smallest integer being considered, followed by a generic argument showing that if the statement holds for a given case, then it must also hold for the next  case in the sequence.  We summarize mathematical induction in the following axiom. </p>

        <p>Induction can also be very useful in formulating definitions. For instance, there are two ways to define <m>n!</m>, the factorial of a positive integer <m>n</m>.<ul>
            <li><p>The <em>explicit</em> definition: <m>n! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdots (n - 1) \cdot n</m>.</p></li>

        <title>The Division Algorithm</title>

        <introduction>

            <p>An application of the Principle of Well-Ordering that we will use often is the division algorithm.</p>

                    <p>Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be integers, with <m>b \gt 0</m>.  Then there exist unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that 
                        <me>a = bq + r</me>
                    where <m>0 \leq r \lt b</m>.</p>
                </statement>
                <proof>
                    <p>This is a perfect example of the existence-and-uniqueness type of proof.  We must first prove that the numbers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> actually  exist. Then we must show that if  <m>q'</m> and <m>r'</m> are two other such numbers, then <m>q = q'</m> and <m>r = r'</m>.</p>

                    <p><em>Existence of <m>q</m> and <m>r</m>.</em> Let
                        <me>S = \{ a - bk : k \in {\mathbb Z} \text{ and } a - bk \geq 0 \}.</me>
                    If <m>0 \in S</m>, then <m>b</m> divides <m>a</m>, and  we can let <m>q = a/b</m> and <m>r = 0</m>.  If <m>0 \notin S</m>, we can use the Well-Ordering Principle.  We must first show that <m>S</m> is nonempty.  If <m>a \gt 0</m>, then <m>a - b \cdot 0 \in S</m>. If <m>a \lt 0</m>, then <m>a - b(2a) = a(1 - 2b) \in S</m>.  In either case <m>S \neq \emptyset</m>.  By the Well-Ordering Principle, <m>S</m> must have a smallest member, say <m>r = a - bq</m>. Therefore, <m>a = bq + r</m>, <m>r \geq 0</m>. We now show that <m>r \lt b</m>. Suppose that <m>r \gt b</m>. Then   
                        <me>a - b(q + 1)= a - bq - b = r - b \gt 0.</me>
                    In this case we would have <m>a - b(q + 1)</m> in the set <m>S</m>. But then <m>a - b(q + 1) \lt a - bq</m>, which would contradict the fact that <m>r = a - bq</m> is the smallest member  of <m>S</m>. So <m>r \leq b</m>.  Since <m>0 \notin S</m>, <m>r \neq b</m> and so <m>r \lt b</m>.</p>

                    <p><em>Uniqueness of <m>q</m> and <m>r</m>.</em> Suppose there exist integers <m>r</m>, <m>r'</m>, <m>q</m>, and <m>q'</m> such that
                        <me>a = bq + r, 0 \leq r \lt b \quad \text{and}\quad a = bq' + r', 0 \leq r' \lt b.</me>
                    Then <m> bq + r =  bq' + r'</m>.  Assume that <m>r' \geq r</m>.  From the last equation we have <m>b(q - q') = r' - r</m>; therefore, <m>b</m> must divide <m>r' - r</m> and <m>0 \leq r'- r \leq r' \lt b</m>.  This is possible only if <m>r' - r = 0</m>.  Hence, <m>r = r'</m> and  <m>q = q'</m>.</p>

            <title>The Euclidean Algorithm</title>

            <p>Among other things, <xref ref="theorem-integers-gcd" /> allows us to compute the greatest common divisor of two integers.</p>

            <example xml:id="example-integers-gcd">
                <title>Greatest Common Divisor of Two Integers</title>
                <p>Let us compute the greatest common divisor of <m>945</m> and <m>2415</m>.  First observe that<md>
                    <mrow>2415 &amp; = 945 \cdot 2 + 525</mrow>
                    <mrow>945 &amp; = 525 \cdot 1 + 420</mrow>
                    <mrow>525 &amp; = 420 \cdot 1 + 105</mrow>
                    <mrow>420 &amp; = 105 \cdot 4 + 0.</mrow>
                </md></p>

                <p>Reversing our steps, 105 divides 420, 105 divides 525, 105 divides 945, and 105 divides 2415.  Hence, 105 divides both 945 and 2415.  If <m>d</m> were another common divisor of 945 and 2415, then <m>d</m> would also have to divide 105.  Therefore, <m>\gcd( 945, 2415 ) = 105</m>.</p>

                <p>If we work backward through the above sequence of equations, we can also obtain numbers <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> such that <m>945 r + 2415 s = 105</m>.  Observe that<md>
                    <mrow>105 &amp; = 525 + (-1) \cdot 420</mrow>
                    <mrow>&amp; = 525 + (-1) \cdot [945 + (-1) \cdot 525]</mrow>
                    <mrow>&amp; = 2 \cdot 525 + (-1) \cdot 945</mrow>
                    <mrow>&amp; = 2 \cdot [2415 + (-2) \cdot 945] + (-1) \cdot 945</mrow>
                    <mrow>&amp; = 2 \cdot 2415 + (-5) \cdot 945.</mrow>
                </md></p>

                <p>So <m>r = -5</m> and <m>s= 2</m>.  Notice that <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> are not unique, since <m>r = 41</m> and <m>s = -16</m> would also work.</p>
            </example>

            <p>To compute <m>\gcd(a,b) = d</m>, we are using repeated divisions to obtain a decreasing sequence of positive integers <m>r_1 \gt r_2 \gt \cdots \gt r_n = d</m>; that is,<md>
                <mrow>b &amp; = a q_1 + r_1</mrow>
                <mrow>a &amp; = r_1 q_2 + r_2</mrow>
                <mrow>r_1 &amp; = r_2 q_3 + r_3</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp; \vdots </mrow>
                <mrow>r_{n - 2} &amp; = r_{n - 1} q_{n} + r_{n}</mrow>
                <mrow>r_{n - 1} &amp; = r_n q_{n + 1}.</mrow>
            </md></p>

            <p>To find <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> such that <m>ar + bs = d</m>, we begin with this last equation and substitute results obtained from the previous equations:<md>
                <mrow>d &amp; = r_n</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp; = r_{n - 2} - r_{n - 1} q_n</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp; = r_{n - 2} - q_n( r_{n - 3} - q_{n - 1} r_{n - 2} )</mrow>
                <mrow>&amp; = -q_n r_{n - 3} + ( 1+ q_n q_{n-1} ) r_{n - 2} </mrow>
                <mrow>&amp; \vdots </mrow>
                <mrow>&amp; = ra + sb.</mrow>
            </md></p>

            <p>The algorithm that we have just used to find the greatest common divisor <m>d</m> of two integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> and to write <m>d</m> as the linear combination of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is known as the <term>Euclidean algorithm</term><idx><h>Euclidean algorithm</h></idx><idx><h>Algorithm</h><h>Euclidean</h></idx>.</p>

            <title>Prime Numbers</title>

            <p>Let <m>p</m> be an integer such that <m>p \gt 1</m>.  We say that <m>p</m> is a <term>prime number</term><idx><h>Prime integer</h></idx>, or simply <m>p</m> is <term>prime</term>, if the only positive numbers that divide <m>p</m> are 1 and <m>p</m> itself.  An integer <m>n \gt 1</m> that is not prime is said to be <term>composite</term><idx><h>Composite integer</h></idx>.</p>

            <lemma xml:id="theorem-integers-prime-divisor">

                <statement>
                    <p>Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be integers and <m>p</m> be a prime number.  If <m>p \mid ab</m>, then either <m>p \mid a</m> or <m>p \mid b</m>.</p>
                </statement>
                <proof>
                    <p>Suppose that <m>p</m> does not divide <m>a</m>.  We must show that <m>p \mid b</m>. Since <m>\gcd( a, p ) = 1</m>, there exist integers <m>r</m> and <m>s</m> such that <m>ar + ps = 1</m>.  So 
                        <me>b = b(ar + ps) = (ab)r + p(bs).</me>
                    Since <m>p</m> divides both <m>ab</m> and itself, <m>p</m> must divide <m>b = (ab)r + p(bs)</m>.</p>

            <theorem xml:id="theorem-integers-infinite-primes">

                <statement>
                    <p>There exist an infinite number of primes.</p>
                </statement>
                <proof>
                    <p>We will prove this theorem by contradiction.  Suppose that there are only a finite number of primes, say <m>p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n</m>.  Let <m>P = p_1  p_2  \cdots  p_n + 1</m>.    Then <m>P</m> must be divisible by some <m>p_i</m> for <m>1 \leq i \leq n</m>. In this  case, <m>p_i</m> must divide <m>P - p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n = 1</m>, which is a contradiction.  Hence, either <m>P</m> is prime or there exists an additional prime number <m>p \neq p_i</m> that divides <m>P</m>.</p>

                <statement>
                    <p>Let <m>n</m> be an integer such that <m>n \gt 1</m>. Then
                        <me>n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_k,</me>
                    where <m>p_1, \ldots, p_k</m> are  primes (not necessarily distinct).  Furthermore, this factorization is unique; that is, if 
                        <me>n = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_l,</me>
                    then <m>k = l</m> and the <m>q_i</m>'s are just the <m>p_i</m>'s rearranged.</p>
                </statement>
                <proof>
                    <p><em>Uniqueness.</em>  To show uniqueness we will use induction on <m>n</m>. The theorem is certainly true for <m>n = 2</m> since in this case <m>n</m> is prime.  Now assume that the result holds for all integers <m>m</m> such that <m>1 \leq m \lt n</m>, and 
                        <me>n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_k = q_1 q_2 \cdots q_l,</me>
                    where <m>p_1 \leq p_2 \leq \cdots \leq p_k</m> and <m>q_1 \leq q_2 \leq \cdots \leq q_l</m>. By <xref ref="theorem-integers-prime-divisor" />, <m>p_1  \mid  q_i</m> for some <m>i = 1, \ldots, l</m> and <m>q_1  \mid  p_j</m> for some <m>j = 1, \ldots, k</m>.  Since all of the <m>p_i</m>'s and <m>q_i</m>'s are prime, <m>p_1 = q_i</m> and  <m>q_1 = p_j</m>. Hence, <m>p_1 = q_1</m> since <m>p_1 \leq p_j = q_1 \leq q_i = p_1</m>.  By the induction hypothesis, 
                        <me>n' = p_2 \cdots p_k = q_2 \cdots q_l</me>
                    has a unique factorization.  Hence, <m>k = l</m> and <m>q_i = p_i</m> for <m>i = 1, \ldots, k</m>.</p>

                    <p><em>Existence.</em> To show existence, suppose that there is some integer that cannot be written as the product of primes.  Let <m>S</m> be the set of all such numbers.  By the Principle of Well-Ordering, <m>S</m> has a smallest number, say <m>a</m>.  If the only positive factors of <m>a</m> are <m>a</m> and 1, then <m>a</m> is prime, which is a contradiction.  Hence, <m>a = a_1 a_2</m> where <m>1 \lt a_1 \lt a</m> and <m>1 \lt a_2 \lt a</m>.  Neither <m>a_1\in S</m> nor <m>a_2 \in S</m>, since <m>a</m> is the smallest element in <m>S</m>.  So<md>
                        <mrow>a_1 &amp; = p_1 \cdots p_r</mrow>

                    </md></p>

                    <p>Therefore, <me>a = a_1 a_2 = p_1 \cdots p_r q_1 \cdots q_s.</me>  So <m>a \notin S</m>, which is a contradiction.</p>

            <title>Historical Note</title>

            <p>Prime numbers were first studied by the ancient Greeks.  Two important results from antiquity are Euclid's proof that an infinite number of primes exist and the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a method of computing all of the prime numbers less than a fixed positive integer <m>n</m>.  One problem in number theory is to find a function <m>f</m> such that <m>f(n)</m> is prime for each integer <m>n</m>. Pierre Fermat (1601?<ndash />1665) conjectured that <m>2^{2^n} + 1</m> was prime for all <m>n</m>, but later it was shown by Leonhard Euler (1707<ndash />1783) that 
                <me>2^{2^5} + 1 = \text{4,294,967,297}</me>
            is a composite number. One of the many unproven conjectures about prime numbers is Goldbach's Conjecture.  In a letter to Euler in 1742, Christian Goldbach stated the conjecture that every even integer with the exception of 2 seemed to be the sum of two primes:  <m>4 = 2 + 2</m>, <m>6 = 3 + 3</m>, <m>8 =3 + 5</m>, <m>\ldots</m>.  Although the conjecture has been verified for the numbers up through <m>4 \times 10^{18}</m>, it has yet to be proven in general.  Since prime numbers play an important role in public key cryptography, there is currently a great deal of interest in determining whether or not a large number is prime.</p>

            <idx><h>Sieve of Eratosthenes</h></idx>  
            <statement>
                <p>One method of computing all of the prime numbers less than a certain fixed positive integer <m>N</m> is to list all of the numbers <m>n</m> such that <m>1 \lt n \lt N</m>.  Begin by eliminating all of the multiples of 2.  Next eliminate all of the multiples of 3. Now eliminate all of the  multiples of 5.  Notice that 4 has already been crossed out.  Continue in this manner, noticing that we do not have to go all the way to <m>N</m>; it suffices to stop at <m>\sqrt{N}</m>. Using this method, compute all of the prime numbers less than <m>N = 250</m>.  We can also use this method to find all of the integers that are relatively prime to an integer <m>N</m>.  Simply eliminate the prime factors of <m>N</m> and all of their multiples.  Using this method, find all of the numbers that are relatively prime to <m>N= 120</m>.  Using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, write a program that will compute all of the primes less than an integer <m>N</m>. </p>
