                <p>
                    This section gives the chapter enough structure so that we may give the chapter multiple worksheets.
                    <fn>The first footnote of the book is not in a worksheet.</fn>
                </p>

                <title>A Simple Worksheet</title>
                <introduction>
                    <title>Introduction</title>
                    <p>
                        This is an introduction paragraph before the exercises start.
                        It is long enough to wrap to a second line so we can see any indentation.
                        This worksheet follows <xref ref="section"/>,
                        so that was a cross-reference to outside this worksheet.<fn>The second footnote of the book is in the first worksheet.</fn>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And a second paragraph.
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Here is a <tag>p</tag> inside a list item.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    This list is in the introduction.
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>
                                            <title>With Title</title>
                                            <p>
                                                And here is some nesting. And this nested item has a sentence that is very long; so long that it goes onto a second line so we can see indentation.
                                                <ol>
                                                    <li>
                                                        <p>
                                                            More nesting.
                                                        </p>
                                                    </li>
                                                </ol>
                                            </p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                This is an item <em>not</em> in a <tag>p</tag>.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        It is also has a lot of extra words in it so that it will be long enough to wrap to a second line so we can see any indentation.
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    It also has a second list.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And a third paragraph.
                        It is also has a lot of extra words in it so that it will be long enough to wrap to a second line so we can see any indentation.
                        And now it has an unordered list.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    An item.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                Another item.
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>
                                                        <p>
                                                            Three deep.
                                                            <ul>

                                                                </li>

                                    An item. Next list changes label from default to square.

                                    Can be soft or crunchy.  We need this sentence to be very long so we can see what happens when the text wraps to the next line.
                                </p>
