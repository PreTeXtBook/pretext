                    This section gives the chapter enough structure so that we may give the chapter multiple worksheets.

                        This is an introduction paragraph before the exercises start.
                        It is long enough to wrap to a second line so we can see any indentation.
                        <fn>The second footnote of the book is in the first worksheet.</fn>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And a second paragraph.
                        It is also has a lot of extra words in it so that it will be long enough to wrap to a second line so we can see any indentation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And a third paragraph.
                        It is also has a lot of extra words in it so that it will be long enough to wrap to a second line so we can see any indentation.

                            This is the first exercise. Its first paragraph is so long that the text will wrap to the second line so that we can see any indentation.
                            <fn>The third footnote of the book is also in the first worksheet.</fn>

                        <p>
                            There is a second paragraph to see any indentation and any skip.
