<!-- A sample memo -->
<!-- (1) This example assumes 8.5 x 11 paper       -->
<!-- (2) Requires customizing graphics files       -->
<!-- (3) Conversion to LaTeX only                  -->
<!-- (4) Many elements are optional                -->
<!-- (5) pdflatex is superior for graphics formats -->
<!-- (6) xelatex is superior for Unicode support   -->
<!-- (7) no cc, typist in backmatter, send request -->
<!-- (8) no running title on later pages yet       -->

<!-- Copy sample graphics (masthead, intitals) to the directory where you compile LaTeX -->
