    <title>Sage</title>

    <p>The first half of this text is about group theory.  Sage includes Groups, Algorithms and Programming (GAP), a program designed primarly for just group theory, and in continuous development since 1986.  Many of Sage's computations for groups ultimately are performed by GAP.</p>
