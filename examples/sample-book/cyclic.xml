    <introduction>
        <p>The groups <m>\mathbb Z</m> and <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>, which are among the most familiar and easily understood groups, are both examples of what are called cyclic groups.  In this chapter we will study the properties of cyclic groups and cyclic subgroups, which play a fundamental part in the classification of all abelian groups.</p>
    </introduction>

    <section>
        <title>Cyclic groups</title>

        <p>Often a subgroup will depend entirely on a single element of the group; that is, knowing that particular element will allow us to compute any other element in the subgroup.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-cyclic-z3">
            <title>An Infinite Cyclic Subgroup, Modular Addition</title>
           <p>Suppose that we consider <m>3 \in {\mathbb Z}</m> and look at all multiples (both positive and negative) of 3.  As a set, this is <me>3 {\mathbb Z} = \{ \ldots, -3, 0, 3, 6, \ldots \}</me>. It is easy to see that <m>3 {\mathbb Z}</m> is a subgroup of the integers.  This subgroup is completely determined by the element 3 since we can obtain all of the other elements of the group by taking multiples of 3.  Every element in the subgroup is <q>generated</q> by 3.</p>
        </example>

            <title>An Infinite Cyclic Subgroup, Multiplication of Rational Numbers</title>
            <p>If <m>H = \{ 2^n : n \in {\mathbb Z} \}</m>, then <m>H</m> is a subgroup of the multiplicative group of nonzero rational numbers, <m>{\mathbb Q}^*</m>.  If <m>a = 2^m</m> and <m>b = 2^n</m> are in <m>H</m>, then <m>ab^{-1} = 2^m 2^{-n} = 2^{m-n}</m> is also in <m>H</m>.  By <xref ref="proposition-subgroup" />, <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>{\mathbb Q}^*</m> determined by the element 2.</p>

            <statement>
                <p>Let <m>G</m> be a group and <m>a</m> be any element in <m>G</m>.  Then the set <me>\langle a \rangle  = \{ a^k : k \in {\mathbb Z} \}</me> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>.  Furthermore, <m>\langle a \rangle</m> is the smallest subgroup of <m>G</m> that contains~<m>a</m>.<notation>

                </notation></p>
            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p>The identity is in <m>\langle a \rangle </m> since <m>a^0 = e</m>. If <m>g</m> and <m>h</m> are any two elements in <m>\langle a \rangle </m>, then by the definition of <m>\langle a \rangle</m> we can write <m>g = a^m</m> and <m>h = a^n</m> for some integers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>. So <m>gh = a^m a^n = a^{m+n}</m> is again in <m>\langle a \rangle </m>. Finally, if <m>g = a^n</m> in <m>\langle a \rangle </m>, then the inverse <m>g^{-1} = a^{-n}</m> is also in <m>\langle a \rangle </m>. Clearly, any subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m> containing <m>a</m> must contain all the powers of <m>a</m> by closure; hence, <m>H</m> contains <m>\langle a \rangle </m>. Therefore, <m>\langle a \rangle </m> is the smallest subgroup of <m>G</m> containing <m>a</m>.</p>
            </proof>
        </theorem>

        <remark>
            <p>If we are using the <q>+</q> notation, as in the case of the integers under addition, we write <m>\langle a \rangle  = \{ na : n \in {\mathbb Z} \}</m>.</p>
        </remark>

        <p>For <m>a \in G</m>, we call <m>\langle a \rangle </m> the <term>cyclic subgroup</term><idx><h>Subgroup</h><h>cyclic</h></idx> generated by <m>a</m>. If <m>G</m> contains some element <m>a</m> such that <m>G = \langle a \rangle </m>, then <m>G</m> is a <term>cyclic group</term><idx><h>Group</h><h>cyclic</h></idx>. In this case <m>a</m> is a <term>generator</term><idx><h>Generator of a cyclic subgroup</h></idx> of <m>G</m>.  If <m>a</m> is an element of a group <m>G</m>, we define the <term>order</term><idx><h>Element</h><h>order of</h></idx> of <m>a</m> to be the smallest positive integer <m>n</m> such that <m>a^n= e</m>, and we write <m>|a| = n</m>. <notation><usage><m>|a|</m></usage><description>the order of an element <m>a</m></description></notation> If there is no such integer <m>n</m>, we say that the order of <m>a</m> is infinite and  write <m>|a| = \infty</m> to denote the order of <m>a</m>.</p>

            <title>Generators of a Finite Cyclic Group</title>
            <p>Notice that a cyclic group can have more than a single generator. Both 1 and 5 generate <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m>; hence, <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> is a cyclic group. Not every element in a cyclic group is necessarily a generator of the group. The order of <m>2 \in {\mathbb Z}_6</m> is 3. The cyclic subgroup generated by 2 is <m>\langle 2 \rangle  = \{ 0, 2, 4 \}</m>.</p>
        </example>

        <p>The groups <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> and <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m> are cyclic groups. The elements 1 and <m>-1</m> are generators for <m>{\mathbb Z}</m>.

        <title>Subgroups of a Cyclic Group</title>

        <p>We can ask some interesting questions about cyclic subgroups of a group and subgroups of a cyclic group.  If <m>G</m> is a group, which subgroups of <m>G</m> are cyclic? If <m>G</m> is a cyclic group, what type of subgroups does <m>G</m> possess?</p>

        <theorem xml:id="theorem-cyclic-subgroups">
            <statement>
                <p>Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.</p>
            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p>The main tools used in this proof are the division algorithm and the Principle of Well-Ordering. Let <m>G</m> be a cyclic group generated by <m>a</m> and suppose that <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>. If <m>H = \{ e \}</m>, then trivially <m>H</m> is cyclic. Suppose that <m>H</m> contains some other element <m>g</m> distinct from the identity. Then <m>g</m> can be written as <m>a^n</m> for some integer <m>n</m>. Since <m>H</m> is a subgroup, <m>g^{-1} = a^{n}</m> must also be in <m>H</m>.  Since either <m>n</m> or <m>-n</m> is positive, we can assume that <m>H</m> contains positive powers of <m>a</m> and <m>n \gt 0</m>. Let <m>m</m> be the smallest natural number such that <m>a^m \in H</m>. Such an <m>m</m> exists by the Principle of Well-Ordering.</p>

                <p>We claim that <m>h = a^m</m> is a generator for <m>H</m>.  We must show that every <m>h' \in H</m> can be written as a power of <m>h</m>. Since <m>h' \in H</m> and <m>H</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>, <m>h' = a^k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Using the division algorithm, we can find numbers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that <m>k = mq +r</m> where <m>0 \leq r \lt m</m>; hence, <me>a^k = a^{mq +r} = (a^m)^q a^r = h^q a^r</me>. So <m>a^r = a^k h^{-q}</m>. Since <m>a^k</m> and <m>h^{-q}</m> are in <m>H</m>, <m>a^r</m> must also be in <m>H</m>.  However, <m>m</m> was the smallest positive number such that <m>a^m</m> was in <m>H</m>; consequently, <m>r=0</m> and so <m>k=mq</m>. Therefore, <me>h' = a^k = a^{mq} =  h^q</me>
                and <m>H</m> is generated by <m>h</m>.</p>
            </proof>
        </theorem>

        <corollary>
            <statement>
                <p>The subgroups of <m>{\mathbb Z}</m> are exactly <m>n{\mathbb Z}</m> for <m>n = 0, 1, 2,\ldots</m>.</p>
            </statement>
        </corollary>

        <proposition xml:id="proposition-cyclic-subgrp-order">
            <statement>
                <p>Let <m>G</m> be a cyclic group of order <m>n</m> and suppose that <m>a</m> is a generator for  <m>G</m>. Then <m>a^k=e</m> if and only if <m>n</m> divides <m>k</m>.</p>
            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p>First suppose that <m>a^k=e</m>. By the division algorithm, <m>k = nq + r</m> where <m>0 \leq r \lt n</m>; hence, <me>e = a^k = a^{nq + r} = a^{nq} a^r = e a^r = a^r</me>. Since the smallest positive integer <m>m</m> such that <m>a^m = e</m> is <m>n</m>, <m>r= 0</m>.</p>

                <p>Conversely, if <m>n</m> divides <m>k</m>, then <m>k=ns</m> for some integer <m>s</m>. Consequently, <me>a^k = a^{ns} = (a^n)^s = e^s = e</me>.</p>

            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p>We wish to find the smallest integer <m>m</m> such that <m>e = b^m = a^{km}</m>. By <xref ref="proposition-cyclic-subgrp-order" />, this is the smallest integer <m>m</m> such that <m>n</m> divides <m>km</m> or, equivalently, <m>n/d</m> divides <m>m(k/d)</m>.  Since <m>d</m> is the greatest common divisor of <m>n</m> and <m>k</m>, <m>n/d</m> and <m>k/d</m> are relatively prime. Hence, for <m>n/d</m> to divide <m>m(k/d)</m> it must divide <m>m</m>.  The smallest such <m>m</m> is <m>n/d</m>.</p>

        <title>Cyclic Groups of Complex Numbers</title>

        <p>The <term>complex numbers</term> are defined as <me>{\mathbb C} = \{ a + bi : a, b \in {\mathbb R} \}</me>, where <m>i^2 = -1</m>.  If <m>z = a + bi</m>, then <m>a</m> is the <term>real part</term> of <m>z</m> and <m>b</m> is the <term>imaginary part</term> of <m>z</m>.</p>

        <p>To add two complex numbers <m>z=a+bi</m> and <m>w= c+di</m>, we just add the corresponding real and imaginary parts: <me>z + w=(a + bi ) + (c + di)  =  (a + c) + (b + d)i</me>. Remembering that <m>i^2 = -1</m>,  we multiply complex numbers just like polynomials. The product of <m>z</m> and <m>w</m> is <me>(a + bi )(c + di)  =   ac + bdi^2 + adi + bci =  (ac -bd) +(ad + bc)i</me>.</p>

        <p>Every nonzero complex number <m>z = a +bi</m> has a multiplicative inverse; that is, there exists a <m>z^{-1} \in {\mathbb C}^\ast</m> such that <m>z z^{-1} = z^{-1} z = 1</m>. If <m>z = a + bi</m>, then <me>z^{-1} = \frac{a-bi}{ a^2 + b^2  }</me>. The <term>complex conjugate</term><idx><h>Conjugate, complex</h></idx> of a complex number <m>z = a + bi</m> is defined to be <m>\overline{z} = a- bi</m>.  The <term>absolute value</term> or <term>modulus</term> of  <m>z = a + bi</m>  is <m>|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}</m>.</p>

        <p>There are several ways of graphically representing complex numbers. We can represent a complex number <m>z = a +bi</m> as an ordered pair on the <m>xy</m> plane where <m>a</m> is the <m>x</m> (or real) coordinate and <m>b</m> is the <m>y</m> (or imaginary) coordinate. This is called the <term>rectangular</term> or <term>Cartesian</term> representation. The rectangular representations of <m>z_1 = 2 + 3i</m>, <m>z_2 = 1 - 2i</m>, and <m>z_3 = - 3 + 2i</m> are depicted in <xref ref="figure-rectcoord" />.</p>

        <p>Nonzero complex numbers can also be represented using <term>polar coordinates</term>.  To specify  any nonzero point on the plane, it suffices to give an angle <m>\theta</m> from the positive <m>x</m> axis in the counterclockwise direction and a distance <m>r</m> from the origin, as in <xref ref="figure-polarcoord" />. We can see that <me>z = a + bi = r( \cos \theta + i \sin \theta)</me>. Hence, <me>r = |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}</me> and <md>

To assure that the representation of <m>z</m> is  well-defined, we also require that <m>0^{\circ} \leq \theta \lt 360^{\circ}</m>.

            <p>Conversely, if we are given a rectangular representation of a complex number, it is often useful to know the number's polar representation. If <m>z = 3 \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}\, i</m>, then <me>r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{36 } = 6</me> and <me>\theta = \arctan \left( \frac{b}{a} \right) = \arctan( - 1) = 315^{\circ}</me>, so <m>3 \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}\, i=6 \cis  315^{\circ}</m>.</p>

        <title>Large Powers of Integers</title>

        <p>Computing large powers can be very time-consuming. Just as anyone can compute <m>2^2</m> or <m>2^8</m>, everyone knows how to compute
            <me>2^{2^{1000000} }</me>.
        However, such numbers are so large that we do not want to attempt the calculations; moreover, past a certain point the computations would not be feasible even if we had every computer in the world at our disposal. Even writing down the decimal representation of a very large number may not be reasonable. It could be thousands or even millions of digits long. However, if we could compute something like <m>2^{37398332 } \pmod{ 46389}</m>, we could very easily write the result down since it would be a number between 0 and 46,388. If we want to compute powers modulo <m>n</m> quickly and efficiently, we will have to be clever.<fn>The results in this section are needed only in <xref ref="integers"/> (not really).</fn></p>

        <p>The first thing to notice is that any number <m>a</m> can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2; that is, we can write <me>a = 2^{k_1} + 2^{k_2} + \cdots + 2^{k_n}</me>, where <m>k_1 \lt k_2 \lt \cdots \lt k_n</m>.  This is just the binary representation of <m>a</m>. For example, the binary representation of 57 is 111001, since we can write <m>57 = 2^0 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5</m>.</p>

        <p>The laws of exponents still work in <m>{\mathbb Z}_n</m>; that is, if <m>b \equiv a^x \pmod{ n}</m> and <m>c \equiv a^y \pmod{ n}</m>, then <m>bc \equiv a^{x+y} \pmod{ n}</m>. We can compute <m>a^{2^k} \pmod{ n}</m> in <m>k</m> multiplications by computing<md>
            <mrow>a^{2^0} \pmod{ n}</mrow>
            <mrow>a^{2^1} \pmod{ n }</mrow>
            <mrow>\vdots</mrow>
            <mrow>a^{2^k} \pmod{ n}</mrow>
        </md>.  Each step involves squaring the answer obtained in the previous step, dividing by <m>n</m>, and taking the remainder.</p>

        <example xml:id="example-cyclic-repeated-squares">
            <title>Repeated Squares</title>
            <p>We will compute <m>271^{321} \pmod{ 481}</m>. Notice that <me>321 = 2^0 +2^6 + 2^8</me>; hence, computing <m>271^{321} \pmod{ 481}</m> is the same as computing <me>271^{2^0 +2^6 + 2^8 } \equiv 271^{2^0} \cdot 271^{2^6} \cdot 271^{2^8} \pmod{481}</me>. So it will suffice to compute <m>271^{2^i} \pmod{481}</m> where <m>i = 0, 6, 8</m>. It is very easy to see that <me>271^{2^1}  = \mbox{73,441} \equiv 329 \pmod{481}</me>. We can square this result to obtain a value for <m>271^{2^2} \pmod{481}</m>:<md>

                <mrow>&amp; \equiv 16 \pmod{ 481}</mrow>
            </md>.  We are using the fact that <m>(a^{2^n})^2  \equiv a^{2 \cdot 2^n} \equiv a^{ 2^{n+1} } \pmod{ n}</m>. Continuing, we can calculate <me>271^{ 2^6 } \equiv 419 \pmod{ 481}</me> and <me>271^{ 2^8 }  \equiv 16 \pmod{ 481}</me>. Therefore,<md>
