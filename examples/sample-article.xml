                <title>A Pedagogical Note</title>

                <p>The Fundamental Theorem explains why we use the same notation for a definite integral, which is a numerical calculation,<fn>Which I think sometimes students lose sight of.</fn> and an antiderivative, which is a symbolic expression.</p>

                    <p>Using an <q>integral sign</q> for an antiderivative (aka indefinite integral) would seem to make the Fundamental Theorem a <foreign>fait accompli</foreign>.  So I would suggest not conflating the notation for two very different things until the Fundamental Theorem exposes them as being highly related.</p>
