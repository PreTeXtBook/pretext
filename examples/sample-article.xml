            <index><main>Numerical integration</main><see>Sage integration</see></index>

            <p>Sage can compute definite integrals.  The output contains the approximate numerical value of the definite integral, followed by an upper bound  of the error in the approximation.</p>

            <sage xml:id="sage-numerical-integral">
                <input>numerical_integral(sin(x)^2, (0, 2))</input>
                <!-- need to use wildcard matching to make this doctestable -->
                <output>(1.189200623826982, 1.320277913471315e-14)</output>
            </sage>

            <p>Given the Fundamental Theorem, we would find the antiderivative useful.</p>

            <sage>
                <input>integral(sin(x)^2, x)</input>
                <output>1/2*x - 1/4*sin(2*x)</output>
            </sage>

            <p>The same command can be used to employ the antiderivative in the application of the Fundamental Theorem.  Notice that the answer is <em>exact</em> and any further manipulation is likely to be simply producing a numerical approximation.</p>

            <!-- The "full" type is the default, it is used here only for testing purposes -->
            <sage type="full">
                <input>integral(sin(x)^2, (x, 0, 2))</input>
                <output>-1/4*sin(4) + 1</output>
            </sage>

            <p>There are integrals you really do not want to evaluate, or you do not want your reader to evaluate.  A Sage cell can be configured for display purposes only <mdash /> you can look but you cannot touch.</p>

            <sage type="display">
                <input>integral(e^(x^2), x)</input>
                <output>-1/2*I*sqrt(pi)*erf(I*x)</output>
            </sage>

            <p>You can give a Sage element a <c>doctest</c> attribute, whose value mirrors the optional hash tags used in Sage doctests.  Possible values are <c>random</c>, <c>long time</c>, <c>not implemented</c>, <c>not tested</c>, <c>known bug</c>, <c>absolute</c>, <c>relative</c>, and <c>optional</c>.  The values <c>absolute</c> and <c>relative</c> refer to floating-point tolerances for equality and require a second attribute <c>tolerance</c> to specify a floating point value.  The value <c>optional</c> refers to the test requiring that an optional Sage package be present.  The name of that package should be provided in the <c>package</c> attribute.</p>

            <p>The next cell is marked in the source as <c>doctest="random"</c>, and so is specified as unpredictable and not tested.  But there is some <q>sample</q> output which will appear in the <latex /> version (and always be the same).</p>

            <sage doctest="random">
                <input>random()</input>
                <output>0.11736021338650582</output>
            </sage>

            <p>While the next cell is random, the returned value will never be more than <m>0.01</m> away from <m>12</m>, since the <c>random()</c> function stays between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>.  So we provide <m>12.005</m> as the expected answer, but test with an absoluute tolerance of <m>\epsilon=0.006</m>.</p>

            <sage doctest="absolute" tolerance="0.006">
                <input>12 + 0.01*random()</input>
                <output>12.005</output>
            </sage>

            <p>Here is a blank Sage cell that you may use for practice and experimentation with the commands above.</p>

            <sage type="practice" />

            <p>You can make Sage blocks which are of <c>type="invisible"</c>, which will never be shown to a reader, but which get doctested.  Why do this?  If some code produces an error, and you hope it is fixed someday, use an invisible block to raise the error.  Once fixed, the doctest will fail, and you can adjust your commentary to suit.  There is such a block right now, <em>but</em> you will need to go to the source to see it.</p>

            <p>Lists can have multiple columns.  With HTML items displayed in row-major order (horizontally first) and with <latex /> items are displayed in column-major order (vertically first).  When one order, or the other, becomes workable in both variants, maybe we will be consistent in presentation.  (Note that with just one row, it makes no difference.)  We used it above for the two items <mdash /> derivatives and integrals <mdash /> where each item was a list of its own.  Here are two more examples, one with short snippets and lots of columns, the other with lots of text in paragraphs.<index xml:id="index-start-multicolumn" finish="index-finish-multicolumn"><main>Lists</main><sub>multicolumn</sub></index></p>

            <p>The Asymptote graphics language may be placed in your source to draw pictures.  For <latex /> processing you must have Asymptote's style file, <c>asymptote.sty</c>, available, and then it is a three-step process: <latex />, <c>asy</c>, <latex />.  For these reasons, the source is commented-out and you will see nothing below.  So you need to edit <c>sample-article.tex</c> if you want to experiment.  Rules for formatting code are identical to those for Sage code.  For more on Asymptote and <latex /> see <url href="http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/doc/LaTeX-usage.html" />.</p>

                <p>With a totally empty <q>geogebra</q> element, you will get a blank slate to play around in.   This is based on an example of embedding GeoGebra into Sage notebooks by Bruce Cohen.  Notice the full suite of menus and tools (in contrast to the previous example).</p>

                <p>Again, this example will run with Java.  GeoGebra demonstrations can be run via HTML5 without invoking Java, but this seems to only be possible in the Chrome browser.  Support will be expanded, especially if requested.</p>

            <title>Exercises</title>

            <introduction>
                <p>Exercises in an <q>exercises</q> section are numbered automatically.  However, what if you have a busted problem and remove it?  Then a bunch of problem numbers change and your list of homework for your students changes as well.  What a mess.  Use auto-numbering while writing and refining.  Once stable, go ahead and hard-code problem numbers as you delete/add.  Notice the oddly numbered problem below.  Once you go down this road, you can't stop.  But instructors will thank you for it.</p>
            </introduction>

            <exercise>
                <title>An Exercise in a Section</title>
                <statement>
                    <p>Exercises can appear in a <q>section</q> of their own.  You need to give the section a title, even if it seems obvious what to call it.  Individual exercises may have titles, as you choose.  Problem: How should we hide solutions?</p>
                </statement>
                <solution>
                    <p>Maybe a global switch should be used to supress solutions, while a separate processing regime could use them as part of a solutions manual.</p>
                </solution>
            </exercise>

            <exercise number="42a">
                <statement>
                    <p>Compute the definite integral <m>\definiteintegral{2}{4}{x^2}{x}</m>, not as an approximate value from a Riemann sum, but as an exact value based of the limit by using the Fundamental Theorem.</p>
                </statement>
                <solution>
                    <p>An antiderivative of <m>x^2</m> is <m>F(x)=x^3/3</m>, so by the FTC,<me>\definiteintegral{2}{4}{x^2}{x}=F(4)-F(2)=\frac{1}{3}\left(4^3-2^3\right)=\frac{56}{3}.</me></p>
                </solution>
            </exercise>

            <exercise>
                <statement>
                    <p>Can you prove Corollary<nbsp /><xref ref="corollary-FTC-derivative" /> directly?</p>
                </statement>
                <hint>
                    <p>Consider the definite integral as an area function and employ the Mean Value Theorem.</p>
                </hint>
            </exercise>

         </exercises>

        Various author tools are planned.  Note the embedded "todo"
        elements above.  An XSL transform in-testing will extract them
        for a report, and they are hidden in actual output.
        For a cross-reference, instead of a "ref" atrribute,
        you can use a "provisional" attribute while writing, which is
        especially useful for unknown forward references.  This is
        included in the author report also.
        A "preview" XSL transform to HTML could be especially useful.

            <title>Internationalization</title>

            <p>Accented characters and different alphabets may be entered directly into your source file.  How you do this is dependent on your operating system and is outside the scope of our documentation.  You can cut/paste from the source of this document for initial testing and experimentation.  Likely you need the incantation <c latexsep="!">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt;</c> as the first line of your source file. (Maybe don't cut/paste this one here, it may have weird characters in it, go back to the top of this source file.)</p>

            <p>Usage is simple: process your <latex /> output with the <c>xelatex</c> executable rather than <c>pdflatex</c>.  Adjustment in your <latex /> preamble will take place automatically.  For HTML ouput, your browser will be responsible for displaying the characters.  None of this has been tested thoroughly, so please send reports of failures or successful modifications.</p>

            <p>Here are some sample characters from Alan Wood’s <url href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/unicode_samples.html">Unicode Resources</url>, which seem to be available in a default TeXLive installation.  The sample entries below will mostly be empty if you do not process this file with <c>xelatex</c>.</p>

            <title>Program Listings</title>

            <p>Sage cells can be used for Python examples, but Sage uses a mild amount of pre-parsing, so that might not be a wise decision, especially in instructional settings.  We might implement Skulpt (in-browser Python) or the Python language argument to the Sage Cell Server.</p>

            <p>In the meantime, program listings, especially with syntax highlighting, is useful all by itself.  The <q>R</q> language might not be a bad stand-in for pseudo-code, as it supports assignment with a left arrow and has fairly generic procedural syntax for control structures and data structures.  Or maybe Pascal would be a good choice?  Here is an example of R.</p>

            <p>Look in the <c>mathbook-common.xsl</c> file to see the strings to use to identify languages.  Always all-lowercase, no symbols, no punctuation.</p>

            <conclusion>
                <p>There is an index manufactured for the <latex /> verion, which contains a few entries.  Look at the source of this XML file to see how they are written.  They may be placed inside of paragraphs (<c>&lt;p&gt;</c>) and statements (<c>&lt;statements&gt;</c>), and probably other places as well <mdash /> this should be liberalized.  Look at the preamble of the generated <latex /> file for instructions on generating the index.  No other converters are producing an index.</p>

                <p>There is an index entry about multicolumn lists which spans more than one page.  This requires doubly-linked index entries, the first has the index content and points to the <c>xml:id</c> of the second.  The second is an empty element, but points back to the <c>xml:id</c> of the first entry.  So each has a marker and a reference, which allows the span of the index topic to cut across XML boundaries in the source.  See the source of this article for syntax details.</p>
