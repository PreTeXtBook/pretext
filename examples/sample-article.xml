        Multi-line displays ("md", "mdn") require that lines
        be delimited as "math rows" with the "mrow" element.
        These displays are implemented with the AMSMath align
        environment, which uses ampersands (&) for formatting
        control.  This is an evil situation, but the (easy) way
        around it is to use "&amp;" in this situation.
