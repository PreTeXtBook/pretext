            <p>The Asymptote graphics language may be placed in your source to draw pictures.  For <latex /> processing you must have Asymptote's style file, <c>asymptote.sty</c>, available, and then it is a three-step process: <latex />, <c>asy</c>, <latex />.  For these reasons, the source is commented-out and you will see nothing below.  So you need to edit <c>sample-article.tex</c> if you want to experiment.  Rules for formatting code are identical to those for Sage code.  For more on Asymptote and <latex /> see <url href="http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/doc/LaTeX-usage.html" />.</p>

You can make a <q>references</q> subdivion anywhere to hold bibliographic items, and you can reference the items like any other item.

            <title>Embedded Interactive Elements</title>

            <p>When outputting Web page versions, it is possible to embed a variety of dynamic interactive elements.  In a <latex />/PDF version, these will necessarily need to be replaced by some static substitute, such as a screenshot.</p>

            <subsection>
                <title>GeoGebra</title>

                <p>This first example of a  GeoGebra demonstration has just the controls for moving the three vertices on the circumfrence of the circle.  This is courtesy of Danny Parsons at the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences.  This demo requires Java, which could be problematic.</p>

                <p>GeoGebra will create screenshots of demonstrations in tikz/<latex /> code.  For a static version, we use this as a figure.</p>

               <!-- 1. Build a GeoGebra applet                            -->
               <!-- 2. Save it as an HTML page                            -->
               <!-- 3. Open the HTML and find the Base64 encoded version  -->
               <!-- 4. Copy (with no line breaks!) into ggbBase64 element -->

                <p>With a totally empty <q>geogebra</q> element, you will get a blank slate to play around in.   This is based on an example of embedding GeoGebra into Sage notebooks by Bruce Cohen.  Notice the full suite of menus and tools (in contrast to the previous example).</p>

                <p>Again, this example will run with Java.  GeoGebra demonstrations can be run via HTML5 without invoking Java, but this seems to only be possible in the Chrome browser.  Support will be expanded, especially if requested.</p>

            <p>Embedded videos can make sense for a web version of your document. This is a video promoting the University of Puget Sound to potential new students.  Support is limited to WebM format initially, mp4 support will be easy to add.  This may require an HTML5 capable browser, such as Chrome, to render properly.</p>

                <statement>
                    <p>Exercises can appear in a <q>section</q> of their own.  You need to give the section a title, even if it seems obvious what to call it.  They are numbered automatically.  How should we hide solutions?</p>
                </statement>
                <solution>
                    <p>Maybe a global switch should be used to supress solutions, while a separate processing regime could use them as part of a solutions manual.</p>
                </solution>
            </exercise>

            <exercise>
                <statement>
                    <p>Compute the definite integral <m>\definiteintegral{2}{4}{x^2}{x}</m>, not as an approximate value from a Riemann sum, but as an exact value based of the limit by using the Fundamental Theorem.</p>
                </statement>
                <solution>
                    <p>An antiderivative of <m>x^2</m> is <m>F(x)=x^3/3</m>, so by the FTC,<me>\definiteintegral{2}{4}{x^2}{x}=F(4)-F(2)=\frac{1}{3}\left(4^3-2^3\right)=\frac{56}{3}.</me></p>
                </solution>
            </exercise>

            <exercise>
                <statement>
                    <p>Can you prove Corollary<nbsp /><xref ref="corollary-FTC-derivative" /> directly?</p>
                </statement>
                <hint>
                    <p>Consider the definite integral as an area function and employ the Mean Value Theorem.</p>
                </hint>

        Various author tools are planned.  Note the embedded "todo"
        elements above.  An XSL transform in-testing will extract them
        for a report, and they are hidden in actual output.
        For a cross-reference, instead of a "ref" atrribute,
        you can use a "provisional" attribute while writing, which is
        especially useful for unknown forward references.  This is
        included in the author report also.
        A "preview" XSL transform to HTML could be especially useful.
