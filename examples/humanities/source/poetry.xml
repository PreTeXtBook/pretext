            <title>No Second Troy</title>
            <author>William Butler Yeats</author>
            <stanza>
                <line>Why should I blame her that she filled my days</line>
                <line>With misery, or that she would of late</line>
                <line>Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,</line>
                <line>Or hurled the little streets upon the great,</line>
                <line>Had they but courage equal to desire?</line>
                <line>What could have made her peaceful with a mind</line>
                <line>That nobleness made simple as a fire,</line>
                <line>With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind</line>
                <line>That is not natural in an age like this,</line>
                <line>Being high and solitary and most stern?</line>
                <line>Why, what could she have done, being what she is?</line>
                <line>Was there another Troy for her to burn?</line>

            <title>The Lake Isle of Innisfree</title>
            <author>William Butler Yeats</author>
            <stanza>
                <line>I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,</line>
                <line>And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made:</line>
                <line>Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honeybee,</line>
                <line>And live alone in the bee-loud glade.</line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,</line>
                <line>Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;</line>
                <line>There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,</line>
                <line>And evening full of the linnet's wings.</line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>I will arise and go now, for always night and day</line>
                <line>I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;</line>
                <line>While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,</line>
                <line>I hear it in the deep heart's core.</line>

            <stanza>
                <line>Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,</line>
                <line>Enwrought with golden and silver light,</line>
                <line>The blue and the dim and the dark cloths</line>
                <line>Of night and light and the half-light,</line>
                <line>I would spread the cloths under your feet:</line>
                <line>But I, being poor, have only my dreams;</line>
                <line>I have spread my dreams under your feet;</line>
                <line>Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.</line>

                <line>Or polite meaningless words,</line>
                <line>Or have lingered awhile and said</line>

                <line>So sensitive his nature seemed,</line>
                <line>So daring and sweet his thought.</line>
                <line>This other man I had dreamed</line>
                <line>A drunken, vainglorious lout.</line>
                <line>He had done most bitter wrong</line>

                <line>Yet I number him in the song;</line>
                <line>He, too, has resigned his part</line>
                <line>In the casual comedy;</line>
                <line>He, too, has been changed in his turn,</line>

                <line>As a mother names her child</line>
                <line>When sleep at last has come</line>
                <line>On limbs that had run wild.</line>
                <line>What is it but nightfall?</line>
                <line>No, no, not night but death;</line>
                <line>Was it needless death after all?</line>
                <line>For England may keep faith</line>
                <line>For all that is done and said.</line>
                <line>We know their dream; enough</line>
                <line>To know they dreamed and are dead;</line>
                <line>And what if excess of love</line>
                <line>Bewildered them till they died?</line>
                <line>I write it out in a verse -</line>
                <line>MacDonagh and MacBride</line>
                <line>And Connolly and Pearse</line>
                <line>Now and in time to be,</line>
                <line>Wherever green is worn,</line>

                <line>The drowsy water-rats;</line>
                <line>There we've hid our faery vats,</line>

                <line>Savage indignation there</line>
                <line>Cannot lacerate his breast.</line>
                <line>Imitate him if you dare,</line>
                <line>World-besotted traveller; he</line>
                <line>Served human liberty.</line>

                <line>The trees are in their autumn beauty,</line>
                <line>The woodland paths are dry,</line>
                <line>Under the October twilight the water</line>
                <line>Mirrors a still sky;</line>
                <line>Upon the brimming water among the stones</line>
                <line>Are nine-and-fifty swans.</line>

                <line>Since I first made my count;</line>
                <line>I saw, before I had well finished,</line>
                <line>All suddenly mount</line>
                <line>And scatter wheeling in great broken rings</line>
                <line>Upon their clamorous wings.</line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>I have looked upon those brilliant creatures,</line>
                <line>And now my heart is sore.</line>
                <line>All's changed since I, hearing at twilight,</line>
                <line>The first time on this shore,</line>
                <line>The bell-beat of their wings above my head,</line>
                <line>Trod with a lighter tread.</line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>Unwearied still, lover by lover,</line>
                <line>They paddle in the cold</line>
                <line>Companionable streams or climb the air;</line>
                <line>Their hearts have not grown old;</line>
                <line>Passion or conquest, wander where they will,</line>

            </stanza>

                <line>But now they drift on the still water,</line>

                <line>Among what rushes will they build,</line>
                <line>By what lake's edge or pool</line>
                <line>Delight men's eyes when I awake some day</line>
                <line>To find they have flown away?</line>

                <line>There is a singer everyone has heard,</line>
                <line>Loud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird,</line>
                <line>Who makes the solid tree trunks sound again.</line>
                <line>He says that leaves are old and that for flowers</line>
                <line>Mid-summer is to spring as one to ten.</line>
                <line>He says the early petal-fall is past</line>
                <line>When pear and cherry bloom went down in showers</line>
                <line>On sunny days a moment overcast;</line>
                <line>And comes that other fall we name the fall.</line>
                <line>He says the highway dust is over all.</line>
                <line>The bird would cease and be as other birds</line>
                <line>But that he knows in singing not to sing.</line>
                <line>The question that he frames in all but words</line>
                <line>Is what to make of a diminished thing.</line>

                <line>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</line>
                <line>And sorry I could not travel both</line>
                <line>And be one traveler, long I stood</line>

                <line>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>Then took the other, as just as fair,</line>
                <line>And having perhaps the better claim,</line>
                <line>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</line>
                <line>Though as for that the passing there</line>

                <line>And both that morning equally lay</line>

                <line>Oh, I kept the first for another day!</line>
                <line>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</line>
                <line>I doubted if I should ever come back.</line>

                <line>I shall be telling this with a sigh</line>

                <line>Now the chimney was all of the house that stood,</line>

            <stanza>
                <line>The barn opposed across the way,</line>

                <line>And the dry pump flung up an awkward arm;</line>
                <line>And the fence post carried a strand of wire.</line>

                <line>For them there was really nothing sad.</line>

            <author>Robert Frost</author>
            <stanza>
                <line>Something there is that doesn't love a wall,</line>
                <line>That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,</line>
                <line>And spills the upper boulders in the sun;</line>
                <line>And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.</line>
                <line>The work of hunters is another thing:</line>
                <line>I have come after them and made repair</line>
                <line>Where they have left not one stone on a stone,</line>
                <line>But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,</line>
                <line>To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,</line>
                <line>No one has seen them made or heard them made,</line>
                <line>But at spring mending-time we find them there.</line>
                <line>I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;</line>
                <line>And on a day we meet to walk the line</line>
                <line>And set the wall between us once again.</line>
                <line>We keep the wall between us as we go.</line>
                <line>To each the boulders that have fallen to each.</line>
                <line>And some are loaves and some so nearly balls</line>
                <line>We have to use a spell to make them balance:</line>
                <line><q/>Stay where you are until our backs are turned!<q/></line>
                <line>We wear our fingers rough with handling them.</line>
                <line>Oh, just another kind of outdoor game,</line>
                <line>One on a side. It comes to little more:</line>
                <line>There where it is we do not need the wall:</line>
                <line>He is all pine and I am apple orchard.</line>
                <line>My apple trees will never get across</line>
                <line>And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.</line>
                <line>He only says, <q/>Good fences make good neighbors.<q/></line>
                <line>Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder</line>
                <line>If I could put a notion in his head:</line>
                <line><lq/>Why do they make good neighbors? Isn't it</line>
                <line>Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.</line>
                <line>Before I built a wall I'd ask to know</line>
                <line>What I was walling in or walling out,</line>
                <line>And to whom I was like to give offense.</line>
                <line>Something there is that doesn't love a wall,</line>
                <line>That wants it down.<rq/> I could say <q/>Elves<q/> to him,</line>
                <line>But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather</line>
                <line>He said it for himself. I see him there</line>
                <line>Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top</line>
                <line>In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.</line>
                <line>He moves in darkness as it seems to me,</line>
                <line>Not of woods only and the shade of trees.</line>
                <line>He will not go behind his father's saying,</line>
                <line>And he likes having thought of it so well</line>
                <line>He says again, <q/>Good fences make good neighbors.<q/></line>

            <stanza>
                <line>My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree</line>

                <line>And there's a barrel that I didn't fill</line>

                <line>Apples I didn't pick upon some bough.</line>
                <line>But I am done with apple-picking now.</line>
                <line>Essence of winter sleep is on the night,</line>
                <line>The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.</line>
                <line>I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight</line>
                <line>I got from looking through a pane of glass</line>
                <line>I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough</line>
                <line>And held against the world of hoary grass.</line>
                <line>It melted, and I let it fall and break.</line>
                <line>But I was well</line>
                <line>Upon my way to sleep before it fell,</line>
                <line>And I could tell</line>
                <line>What form my dreaming was about to take.</line>
                <line>Magnified apples appear and disappear,</line>
                <line>Stem end and blossom end,</line>
                <line>And every fleck of russet showing clear.</line>
                <line>My instep arch not only keeps the ache,</line>
                <line>It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.</line>
                <line>I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.</line>
                <line>And I keep hearing from the cellar bin</line>
                <line>The rumbling sound</line>
                <line>Of load on load of apples coming in.</line>
                <line>For I have had too much</line>
                <line>Of apple-picking: I am overtired</line>
                <line>Of the great harvest I myself desired.</line>
                <line>There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,</line>
                <line>Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall.</line>
                <line>For all</line>
                <line>That struck the earth,</line>
                <line>No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,</line>
                <line>Went surely to the cider-apple heap</line>
                <line>As of no worth.</line>
                <line>One can see what will trouble</line>
                <line>This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.</line>
                <line>Were he not gone,</line>
                <line>The woodchuck could say whether it's like his</line>
                <line>Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,</line>
                <line>Or just some human sleep.</line>

            <author>Robert Frost</author>
            <stanza>
                <line>Out walking in the frozen swamp one gray day</line>
                <line>I paused and said, <lq/>I will turn back from here.</line>
                <line>No, I will go on farther<mdash/>and we shall see.<rq/></line>
                <line>The hard snow held me, save where now and then</line>
                <line>One foot went down. The view was all in lines</line>
                <line>Straight up and down of tall slim trees</line>
                <line>Too much alike to mark or name a place by</line>
                <line>So as to say for certain I was here</line>
                <line>Or somewhere else: I was just far from home.</line>
                <line>A small bird flew before me. He was careful</line>
                <line>To put a tree between us when he lighted,</line>
                <line>And say no word to tell me who he was</line>
                <line>Who was so foolish as to think what he thought.</line>
                <line>He thought that I was after him for a feather<mdash/></line>
                <line>The white one in his tail; like one who takes</line>
                <line>Everything said as personal to himself.</line>
                <line>One flight out sideways would have undeceived him.</line>
                <line>And then there was a pile of wood for which</line>
                <line>I forgot him and let his little fear</line>
                <line>Carry him off the way I might have gone,</line>
                <line>Without so much as wishing him good-night.</line>
                <line>He went behind it to make his last stand.</line>
                <line>It was a cord of maple, cut and split</line>
                <line>And piled and measured, four by four by eight.</line>
                <line>And not another like it could I see.</line>
                <line>No runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it.</line>
                <line>And it was older sure than this year's cutting,</line>
                <line>Or even last year's or the year's before.</line>
                <line>The wood was gray and the bark warping off it</line>
                <line>And the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis</line>
                <line>Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle.</line>
                <line>What held it though on one side was a tree</line>
                <line>Still growing, and on one a stake and prop,</line>
                <line>These latter about to fall. I thought that only</line>
                <line>Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks</line>
                <line>Could so forget his handiwork on which</line>
                <line>He spent himself, the labor of his axe,</line>
                <line>And leave it there far from a useful fireplace</line>
                <line>To warm the frozen swamp as best it could</line>
                <line>With the slow smokeless burning of decay.</line>

            <stanza>
                <line>You were forever finding some new play.</line>
                <line>So when I saw you down on hands and knees</line>
                <line>In the meadow, busy with the new-cut hay,</line>
                <line>Trying, I thought, to set it up on end,</line>
                <line>I went to show you how to make it stay,</line>
                <line>If that was your idea, against the breeze,</line>
                <line>And, if you asked me, even help pretend</line>
                <line>To make it root again and grow afresh.</line>
                <line>But 'twas no make-believe with you to-day,</line>
                <line>Nor was the grass itself your real concern,</line>
                <line>Though I found your hand full of wilted fern,</line>
                <line>Steel-bright June-grass, and blackening heads of clover.</line>
                <line>'Twas a nest full of young birds on the ground</line>
                <line>The cutter-bar had just gone champing over</line>
                <line>(Miraculously without tasting flesh)</line>
                <line>And left defenseless to the heat and light.</line>
                <line>You wanted to restore them to their right</line>
                <line>Of something interposed between their sight</line>
                <line>And too much world at once-could means be found.</line>
                <line>The way the nest-full every time we stirred</line>
                <line>Stood up to us as to a mother-bird</line>
                <line>Whose coming home has been too long deferred,</line>
                <line>Made me ask would the mother-bird return</line>
                <line>And care for them in such a change of scene</line>
                <line>And might our meddling make her more afraid.</line>
                <line>That was a thing we could not wait to learn.</line>
                <line>We saw the risk we took in doing good,</line>
                <line>But dared not spare to do the best we could</line>
                <line>Though harm should come of it; so built the screen</line>
                <line>You had begun, and gave them back their shade.</line>
                <line>All this to prove we cared. Why is there then</line>
                <line>No more to tell? We turned to other things.</line>
                <line>I haven't any memory-have you?</line>
                <line>Of ever coming to the place again</line>
                <line>To see if the birds lived the first night through,</line>
                <line>And so at last to learn to use their wings.</line>

            <stanza>
                <line>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,</line>
                <line>The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,</line>
                <line>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,</line>
                <line>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;</line>
                <line>But O heart! heart! heart!</line>
                <line>O the bleeding drops of red,</line>
                <line>Where on the deck my Captain lies,</line>
                <line>Fallen cold and dead.</line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;</line>
                <line>Rise up<mdash/>for you the flag is flung<mdash/>for you the bugle trills,</line>
                <line>For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths<mdash/>for you the shores a-crowding,</line>
                <line>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;</line>
                <line>Here Captain! dear father!</line>
                <line>This arm beneath your head!</line>
                <line>It is some dream that on the deck,</line>
                <line>You've fallen cold and dead.</line>

            <stanza>
                <line>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,</line>
                <line>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,</line>
                <line>The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,</line>
                <line>From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;</line>
                <line>Exult O shores, and ring O bells!</line>
                <line>But I with mournful tread,</line>
                <line>Walk the deck my Captain lies,</line>
                <line>Fallen cold and dead.</line>

            <title>I saw in Lousiana a live oak growing</title>
            <author>Walt Whitman</author>
            <stanza>
                <line>I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing,</line>
                <line>All alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches,</line>
                <line>Without any companion it grew there uttering joyous leaves of dark green,</line>
                <line>And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself,</line>
                <line>But I wonder'd how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there without its friend near, for I knew I could not,</line>
                <line>And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it, and twined around it a little moss,</line>
                <line>And brought it away, and I have placed it in sight in my room,</line>
                <line>It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends,</line>
                <line>(For I believe lately I think of little else than of them,)</line>
                <line>Yet it remains to me a curious token, it makes me think of manly love;</line>
                <line>For all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in Louisiana solitary in a wide flat space,</line>
                <line>Uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near,</line>
                <line>I know very well I could not.</line>

                <line>The prairie-grass dividing, its special odor breathing,</line>
                <line>I demand of it the spiritual corresponding,</line>
                <line>Demand the most copious and close companionship of men,</line>
                <line>Demand the blades to rise of words, acts, beings,</line>
                <line>Those of the open atmosphere, coarse, sunlit, fresh, nutritious,</line>
                <line>Those that go their own gait, erect, stepping with freedom and command, leading not following,</line>
                <line>Those with a never-quell'd audacity, those with sweet and lusty flesh clear of taint,</line>
                <line>Those that look carelessly in the faces of Presidents and governors, as to say Who are you? Those of earth-born passion, simple, never constrain'd, never obedient,</line>
                <line>Those of inland America.</line>

                <line>No dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you terrible year,</line>

                <line>But as a strong man erect, clothed in blue clothes, advancing, carrying a rifle on your shoulder,</line>
                <line>With well-gristled body and sunburnt face and hands, with a knife in the belt at your side,</line>
                <line>As I heard you shouting loud, your sonorous voice ringing across the continent,</line>
                <line>Your masculine voice O year, as rising amid the great cities,</line>
                <line>Amid the men of Manhattan I saw you as one of the workmen, the dwellers in Manhattan,</line>
                <line>Or with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and Indiana,</line>
                <line>Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait and descending the Alleghanies,</line>
                <line>Or down from the great lakes or in Pennsylvania, or on deck along the Ohio river,</line>
                <line>Or southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers, or at Chattanooga on the mountain top,</line>
                <line>Saw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limbs clothed in blue, bearing weapons, robust year,</line>

                <line>Crouching over a grave an ancient sorrowful mother,</line>
                <line>Once a queen, now lean and tatter'd seated on the ground,</line>
                <line>Her old white hair drooping dishevel'd round her shoulders,</line>
                <line>At her feet fallen an unused royal harp,</line>
                <line>Long silent, she too long silent, mourning her shrouded hope and heir,</line>

                <line>O you need not sit there veil'd in your old white hair so dishevel'd,</line>
                <line>For know you the one you mourn is not in that grave,</line>
                <line>It was an illusion, the son you love was not really dead,</line>
                <line>The Lord is not dead, he is risen again young and strong in another country,</line>
                <line>Even while you wept there by your fallen harp by the grave,</line>
                <line>What you wept for was translated, pass'd from the grave,</line>
                <line>The winds favor'd and the sea sail'd it,</line>
                <line>And now with rosy and new blood,</line>
                <line>Moves to-day in a new country.</line>

                <line>I see before me now a traveling army halting,</line>
                <line>Below a fertile valley spread, with barns and the orchards of summer,</line>
                <line>Behind, the terraced sides of a mountain, abrupt, in places rising high,</line>
                <line>Broken, with rocks, with clinging cedars, with tall shapes dingily seen,</line>
                <line>The numerous camp-fires scatter'd near and far, some away up on the mountain,</line>
                <line>The shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, large-sized, flickering,</line>
                <line>And over all the sky—the sky! far, far out of reach, studded, breaking out, the eternal stars.</line>

                <line>I have travel'd a long way, merely to look on you, to touch you,</line>
                <line>For I could not die till I once look'd on you,</line>
                <line>For I fear'd I might afterward lose you.</line>

            <stanza>
                <line>Now we have met, we have look'd, we are safe,</line>
                <line>Return in peace to the ocean, my love,</line>
                <line>I too am part of that ocean, my love,-we are not so much separated,</line>
                <line>Behold the great rondure<mdash/>the cohesion of all, how perfect!</line>
                <line>But as for me, for you, the irresistible sea is to separate us,</line>
                <line>As for an hour carrying us diverse-yet cannot carry us diverse forever;</line>
                <line>Be not impatient<mdash/>a little space<mdash/>know you I salute the air, the ocean and the land,</line>
                <line>Every day at sundown for your dear sake my love.</line>

                <line>The words of my book nothing, the drift of it every thing,</line>
                <line>A book separate, not link'd with the rest nor felt by the intellect,</line>

                <line>Thou still unravished bride of quietness!</line>
                <line>Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,</line>
                <line>Sylvan historian, who canst thus express</line>
                <line>A flow'ry tale more sweetly than our rhyme:</line>
                <line>What leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shape</line>
                <line>Of deities or mortals, or of both,</line>
                <line>In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?</line>
                <line>What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?</line>
                <line>What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?</line>
                <line>What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?</line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard</line>
                <line>Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;</line>
                <line>Not to the sensual ear, but, more endeared,</line>
                <line>Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:</line>
                <line>Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave</line>
                <line>Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;</line>
                <line>Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,</line>
                <line>Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;</line>
                <line>She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,</line>
                <line>For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!</line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed</line>
                <line>Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;</line>
                <line>And, happy melodist, unwearied,</line>
                <line>For ever piping songs for ever new;</line>
                <line>More happy love! more happy, happy love!</line>
                <line>For ever warm and still to be enjoyed,</line>
                <line>For ever panting and for ever young;</line>
                <line>All breathing human passion far above,</line>
                <line>That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloyed,</line>
                <line>A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.</line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>Who are these coming to the sacrifice?</line>
                <line>To what green altar, O mysterious priest,</line>
                <line>Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,</line>
                <line>And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?</line>
                <line>What little town by river or sea-shore,</line>
                <line>Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,</line>
                <line>Is emptied of its folk, this pious morn?</line>
                <line>And, little town, thy streets for evermore</line>
                <line>Will silent be; and not a soul to tell</line>
                <line>Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.</line>
            </stanza>
            <stanza>
                <line>O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede</line>
                <line>Of marble men and maidens overwrought,</line>
                <line>With forest branches and the trodden weed;</line>
                <line>Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought</line>
                <line>As doth eternity: Cold pastoral!</line>
                <line>When old age shall this generation waste,</line>
                <line>Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe</line>
                <line>Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou sayst,</line>
                <line>"Beauty is truth, truth beauty," that is all</line>
                <line>Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.</line>

                <line>Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art<mdash/></line>
                <line>Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night</line>
                <line>And watching, with eternal lids apart,</line>
                <line>Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,</line>
                <line>The moving waters at their priestlike task</line>
                <line>Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,</line>
                <line>Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask</line>
                <line>Of snow upon the mountains and the moors<mdash/></line>
                <line>No<mdash/>yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,</line>
                <line>Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,</line>
                <line>To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,</line>
                <line>Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,</line>
                <line>Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,</line>
                <line>And so live ever<mdash/>or else swoon to death.</line>

            <stanza>
                <line>It keeps eternal whisperings around</line>
                <line>Desolate shores, and with its mighty swell</line>
                <line>Gluts twice ten thousand caverns, till the spell</line>
                <line>Of Hecate leaves them their old shadowy sound.</line>
                <line>Often 'tis in such gentle temper found,</line>
                <line>That scarcely will the very smallest shell</line>
                <line>Be moved for days from whence it sometime fell,</line>
                <line>When last the winds of heaven were unbound.</line>
                <line>Oh ye! who have your eye-balls vexed and tired,</line>
                <line>Feast them upon the wideness of the Sea;</line>
                <line>Oh ye! whose ears are dinned with uproar rude,</line>
                <line>Or fed too much with cloying melody,</line>
                <line>Sit ye near some old cavern's mouth, and brood</line>
                <line>Until ye start, as if the sea-nymphs choired!</line>

                <line>Conspiring with him how to load and bless</line>
                <line indent="1">With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;</line>
                <line>To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,</line>
                <line indent="1">And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;</line>
                <line indent="2">To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells</line>
                <line>With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,</line>

                <line indent="1">And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;</line>
                <line>Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn</line>
                <line indent="1">Among the river sallows, borne aloft</line>
                <line indent="2">Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;</line>
                <line>And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;</line>
                <line indent="1">Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft</line>
                <line indent="1">The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;</line>

                <line>Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown</line>
                <line>And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command</line>
                <line>Tell that its sculptor well those passions read</line>
                <line>Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,</line>
                <line>The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.</line>
                <line>And on the pedestal these words appear:</line>
                <line><lq/>My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:</line>
                <line>Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!<rq/></line>
                <line>Nothing beside remains: round the decay</line>
                <line>Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,</line>
                <line>The lone and level sands stretch far away.</line>
