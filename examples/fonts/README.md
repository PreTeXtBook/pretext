Characters, Fonts, and Languages
================================

The `fonts-and-charcters.xml` document here is mostly
for testing the use of the `xelatex` LaTeX engine on
the output of `xsl\pretext-latex.html`.  It should also
render well in HTML formats.  With the `pdflatex` engine
it will produce numerous errors (partly by design).
