                <title>Introduction to differential equations</title>

            <introduction>
            <p><em>Note: more than 1 lecture, ยง1.1 in <xref ref="biblio-EP"/>,
            chapter 1 in <xref ref="biblio-BD"/></em></p>
            </introduction>


            <subsection number="0.2.1">
            <title>Differential equations</title>
            <p>
            The laws of physics are generally written down as differential
            equations.  Therefore, all of science and engineering use
            differential equations to some degree.  Understanding
            differential equations is essential to understanding almost anything you will
            study in your science and engineering classes.
            You can think of mathematics as the language of science, and
            differential equations are one of the most important parts of this
            language as far as science and engineering are concerned.  As an analogy,
            suppose all your classes from now on were given in Swahili.  
            It would be important to first learn Swahili, or you would have a very
            tough time getting a good grade in your classes.
            </p>
            <p>
            You saw many
            differential equations already without perhaps knowing about it.
            And you even solved simple
            differential equations when you took calculus.
            Let us see an example you may not have seen:
            <men xml:id="eq1" number="1">
            \frac{dx}{dt} + x = 2 \cos t .
            </men>
            Here <m>x</m> is the <em>dependent variable<idx>dependent variable</idx></em> and <m>t</m> is the
            <em>independent variable<idx>independent variable</idx></em>.
            Equation <xref ref="eq1"/>
            is a basic example of a <em>differential equation<idx>differential equation</idx></em>.  In fact, it
            is an example of a <em>first order differential equation<idx>first order differential equation</idx></em>, since
            it involves only the first derivative of the dependent variable.  This 
            equation arises from Newton's law of cooling where the ambient
            temperature oscillates with time.

            <title>A Bit More Interesting</title>

            <p>The previous section (<xref ref="section-textual" />) was a bit boring.</p>

            <p>This paragraph has some inline math, a Diophantine equation, <m>x^2 + \doubler{y^2} = z^2</m>.  And some display math about infinite series: <me>\sum_{n=1}^\infty\,\frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}.</me>  Look at the XML source to see how <latex /> macros are employed universally across all possible output formats.</p>

        <section xml:id="section-computation">
            <title>Computation</title>

            <p>The following is a chunk of Sage code.  Your output format will dictate what you see next.  In print, you will see expected output.  In HTML you will have an executable, and editable, Sage Cell to work with.  In a SageMathCloud worksheet, you will be able to execute and edit the code with all the other features of SageMathCloud.  Note that if you include the expected output in your source, then you can test the example to verify that the behavior of Sage has not changed.</p> 

            <sage>
                <input>
                A = matrix(4,5, srange(20))
                A.rref()
                </input>
                <output>
                [ 1  0 -1 -2 -3]
