# STACK examples

These examples demonstrate how to author, and process, [STACK](https://stack-assessment.org/) problems for inclusion in a [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org) document.

The process is more involved when your document includes a STACK problem, and requires the support of a server with the STACK API runnin both for one-off generation of a static document, and for ongoing support of students' interactions with dynamic materials.

* The example scripts call the public STACK API server at [https://stack-api.maths.ed.ac.uk/](https://stack-api.maths.ed.ac.uk/)  This server is intended for demonstration and testing only.
