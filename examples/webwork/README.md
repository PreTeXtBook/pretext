# WeBWorK examples

These examples demonstrate how to author, and process, [WeBWorK](http://webwork.maa.org/) automated homework problems for inclusion in a [MathBook XML](https://pretextbook.org) document.

Because the process can be a bit more involved when your document includes a WW problem, we provide a makefile to process the examples and as concrete documentation of how to process your own document.

* copy `Makefile.paths.original` and populate the variables as shown in the `.example` version
* use the `make` command to build various outputs
* read comments in `Makefile` to understand the various scenarios
