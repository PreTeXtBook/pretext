  <p>
    An interesting concept from group theory is that of a Sylow-<m>p</m> subgroup.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <title>Sylow-<m>p</m> subgroup</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>G</m> is a finite group, and <m>p</m> is a prime number,
        and <m>p^k</m> is the largest power of <m>p</m> dividing <m>\order{G}</m>,
        then a <term>Sylow-<m>p</m> subgroup</term> of <m>G</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>
        with order <m>p^k</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    This definition allows <m>k</m> to be <m>0</m>, so <m>p</m> might not divide <m>\order{G}</m>.
    There is a theorem that gives information about how many Sylow-<m>p</m> subgroups a finite group might have.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="theorem-sylow">
    <title>Sylow Theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>G</m> is a finite group and <m>p</m> is a prime dividing <m>\order{G}</m>,
        then the number of Sylow-<m>p</m> subgroups of <m>G</m> divides <m>\order{G}</m>
        and is congruent to <m>1</m> modulo <m>p</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <example>
    <title>Sylow-<m>3</m> subgroups, group of order <m>45</m></title>
    <p>
      If <m>G</m> is a group of order <m>45</m>, how many Sylow-<m>3</m> subgroups could <m>G</m> have?
    </p>
    <p>
      Write <m>n_3</m> to represent the number of Sylow-<m>3</m> subgroups.
      We factor <m>45=9\cdot5</m>, separating the maximal power of <m>3</m> from its complement.
      Since <m>n_3</m> divides <m>45</m> and <m>n_3\equiv1</m> modulo <m>3</m>,
      it follows that <m>n_3</m> divides <m>5</m>. So either <m>n_3=1</m> or <m>n_3=5</m>.
      But of those two options, only <m>1</m> is congruent to <m>1</m> mod <m>3</m>.
      So <m>G</m> must have <m>1</m> Sylow-<m>3</m> subgroup.
    </p>
  </example>

  <exercise>
    <title>Sylow-<m>7</m> subgroups, group of order <m>63</m></title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>G</m> is a group of order <m>63</m>, how many Sylow-<m>7</m> subgroups could <m>G</m> have?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        Factor <m>63</m> and use <xref ref="theorem-sylow"/>.
      </p>
    </hint>
    <answer>
      <p>
        <m>G</m> has <m>1</m> Sylow-<m>7</m> subgroup.
      </p>
    </answer>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Write <m>n_7</m> to represent the number of Sylow-<m>7</m> subgroups.
        We factor <m>63=9\cdot7</m>, separating the maximal power of <m>7</m> from its complement.
        Since <m>n_7</m> divides <m>63</m> and <m>n_7\equiv1</m> modulo <m>7</m>,
        it follows that <m>n_7</m> divides <m>9</m>. So either <m>n_7=1</m>, <m>n_7=3</m>, or <m>n_7=9</m>.
        But of those, only <m>1</m> is a real possibility, since only <m>1</m> is congruent to <m>1</m> mod <m>7</m>.
        So <m>G</m> has <m>1</m> Sylow-<m>7</m> subgroup.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <exercise>
    <title>Sylow-<m>3</m> subgroups, group of order <m>63</m></title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>G</m> is a group of order <m>63</m>, how many Sylow-<m>3</m> subgroups could <m>G</m> have?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        Factor <m>63</m> and use <xref ref="theorem-sylow"/>.
      </p>
    </hint>
    <answer>
      <p>
        <m>G</m> either has <m>1</m> Sylow-<m>3</m> subgroup or it has <m>7</m>.
      </p>
    </answer>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Write <m>n_3</m> to represent the number of Sylow-<m>3</m> subgroups.
        We factor <m>63=9\cdot7</m>, separating the maximal power of <m>3</m> from its complement.
        Since <m>n_3</m> divides <m>63</m> and <m>n_3\equiv1</m> modulo <m>3</m>,
        it follows that <m>n_3</m> divides <m>7</m>. So either <m>n_3=1</m> or <m>n_3=7</m>.
        Both of those are real possibilities, since both are congruent to <m>1</m> mod <m>3</m>.
        So <m>G</m> either has <m>1</m> Sylow-<m>3</m> subgroup or it has <m>7</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </exercise>

  <p>
    Understanding how to count Sylow-<m>p</m> subgroups will help us later when we are classifying finite groups.
