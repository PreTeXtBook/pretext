# EPUB Conversion (Preliminary, 2016-05-19)

The `build.sh` BASH script shows how to use various tools to create the necessary files for an EPUB version of a MathBook XML `book`.  A small uncomplicated test document is included, which does contain non-trivial mathematics and graphics.

The `mathjax-node` program is a major pre-requisite.  See the two different ways to employ it in the script.  See `xsl/mathbook-epub.xsl` for a key component.

Everything here is subject to change and possible relocation.
