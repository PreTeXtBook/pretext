# Quick Reference (aka "quickrefs")

These "cheat sheets" are in the style of similar quick reference sheets pioneered for topical areas of Sage Math software.  Two pages maximum, so they can be printed on one sheet of paper (two-sided).

* `quickref-pretext.tex`: general authoring techniques, initiated by Tom Judson
* `quickref-cli.tex`: basic usage of the PreTeXt CLI, initiated by Tom Judson and Oscar Levin

Authored in LaTeX, given their structure, which would not be well-represented in PreTeXt.  Built PDF versions are available on the PreTeXt website.  If you build your own copies while editing, use `xelatex`, not `pdflatex`.

Extensions, edits, and reorganization are all welcome contributions.  Topics represented by additional quickrefs would also be welcome.
