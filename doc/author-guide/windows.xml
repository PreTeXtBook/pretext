  <title>Windows Installation Notes</title>
  <author>Dave Rosoff</author>

  <introduction>
    <p>This appendix explains the best known way to install the <pretext /> toolchain in a Windows environment, rather than a Unix-flavored operating system (such as Linux and Apple's <init>OS X</init>). It has been tested on Windows 7, 8, and 10. We assume that none of the listed tools or equivalents have been previously installed. That may complicate matters. This is especially true if you use Cygwin, or if you have already installed Python on your machine. <pretext /> compatibility with existing Python installations is addressed elsewhere in this document (<xref provisional="python-mbx-compatibility" />).</p>

    <p>If you have Windows 10, be sure to read about <init>WSL</init> in <xref ref="windows-subsystem-linux" />, which could be a whole lot easier to setup and maintain.</p>

    <title>Setup</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>In this section, we do some initial setup, establish notation, and issue warnings. Some of the steps in this process are dangerous. Typos could lead to an unstable system, or possibly even to unrecoverable system errors. Double-check everything.</p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection xml:id="notation">
      <title>Notation</title>
      <p>Strings enclosed in <c>&lt;angle brackets&gt;</c> are variables whose values you should substitute in typed expressions. <c>&lt;username&gt;</c>, for example, should be replaced with your Windows username (<eg />, mine is <c>drosoff</c>). Throughout this installation process it is very important to pay attention to the direction of slashes <c>/</c> and backslashes <c>\</c>.</p>

      <p>It is easier to see what is happening if your Windows file browser is not set up to hide file extensions from you. Disable the <q>hide file extensions</q> behavior before proceeding. In Windows 7/8, this can be done through the Control Panel. In Windows 10, there is a checkbox somewhere in the ribbon for it.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="a-word-on-path-names">
      <title>A word on path names</title>
      <p>An appallingly large fraction of the difficulties of using GNU/Linux-based utilities with Windows come from the differences in formatting path names. Windows path names begin with a drive letter (usually <q>C</q>) and a colon. Like all path names, they describe a path in a rooted tree. The root directory (folder) in Windows is called <c>\</c>, a backslash. Note the direction carefully. Children of the root node are either subdirectories or files in the root directory (leaves). The path to my downloads folder is:</p>
      <pre>C:\Users\drosoff\Downloads\</pre>
      <p>The trailing backslash is often unnecessary, but it is an easy way to see immediately whether a path name refers to a file or to a directory. Windows path names are not case-sensitive.</p>
      <p>Linux/Mac OS X path names are quite similar, but lack drive letters, start with an explicit reference to the root, use forward slashes, and are case-sensitive (more or less so, in Mac's case). A path to a typical Linux user's download folder might be</p>
      <pre>/home/typical.username/Downloads</pre>
      <p>Again, Linux pathnames are case-sensitive and Mac OS X pathnames are typically <sq>case-preserving</sq>. The Git Bash shell for Windows is an emulation of a Linux environment, and the utilities within it expect path names that follow Linux conventions. So we conform to this expectation as follows.<ol>
        <!-- http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/22297/is-bash-in-osx-case-insensitive -->
        <li><p>Remove the colon, but keep the drive letter.</p></li>
        <li><p>All backslashes <c>\</c> become slashes <c>/</c>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add an initial slash preceding the drive letter.</p></li>
      </ol></p>
      <p>The path name to my Windows download folder becomes</p>
      <pre>/c/users/drosoff/Downloads</pre>
      <p>Even though Git Bash is pretending to be a Linux shell, path names are still the underlying Windows path names, and therefore are not case sensitive. You can verify this using tab-completion.</p>
      <p>Path names that begin with the drive letter (Windows) or the root <c>/</c> (Linux/Mac OS X) are called <term>absolute path names</term>. Their referents do not depend on the location from which the path name is invoked. <term>Relative path names</term>, on the other hand, begin in the so-called <term>current working directory</term>. A relative pathname might look something like this:</p>
      <pre>../../examples/sample-article/sample-article.xml</pre>
      <p>The symbol <c>..</c> is a shortcut for the parent of the current directory. Thus, the relative path name above means from where we are, ascend two levels, then descend into the <c>examples</c> and <c>sample-article</c> subdirectories, and find the file <c>sample-article.xml</c>.</p>
      <p>Path names that contain spaces are <em>evil</em>, and should be avoided in many cases. Unfortunately, all Windows default program installation locations contain at least one space (directory name <q>Program Files</q>). This does not appear to cause problems, except when installing ImageMagick (<xref ref="installing-imagemagick" />). To be extra careful, you could always choose an installation location that is free of space characters.</p>

    <conclusion>
      <p>Now you are ready to begin installing the various pieces of the <pretext /> puzzle. The first one, <c>xsltproc</c> (<xref ref="installing-xsltproc" />), is the most annoying. You might want to go get a snack or another cup of coffee.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="download-and-install-executables-and-linked-libraries">
      <title>xsltproc binaries</title>

      <p>This is the most annoying part of the installation. Obtain four zip archives from <url href="ftp://ftp.zlatkovic.com/libxml/"> Igor Zlatkovic's FTP site</url> that hosts the most recent Libxml binaries for Windows. At the time of this writing, the 64-bit binaries were considered experimental. I have had no trouble using the 32-bit binaries on my 64-bit Windows 7 system, so I suggest that all MBX users download the most recent 32-bit version of the following libraries:</p>
      <list xml:id="list-zip-files-xsltproc">
        <caption><c>xsltproc</c> Zip Files</caption>
        <ol>
          <li><p><c>iconv</c> (filename something like <c>iconv-1.9.2.win32.zip</c>)</p></li>
          <li><p><c>libxml2</c> (filename something like <c>libxml2-2.7.8.win32.zip</c>)</p></li>
          <li><p><c>libxslt</c> (filename something like <c>libxslt-1.1.26.win32.zip</c>)</p></li>
          <li><p><c>zlib</c> (filename something like <c>zlib-1.2.5.win32.zip</c>)</p></li>
        </ol>
      </list>
      <p>We only need a handful of files from these archives. So the simplest thing is to leave them in your Downloads folder and grab what we need. Create a new folder <c>C:\xsltproc</c> (it can be anywhere, as long as it's a new location). We'll call this location <c>&lt;xsltproc&gt;</c> in case you named your folder something different.</p>
      <p>Extract the following files from the four zip archives you downloaded above into <c>&lt;xsltproc&gt;</c>:</p>

            <p>If you created this variable, populate the second field with the full path name of <c>&lt;xsltproc&gt;</c>, the location where you put the seven files from Igor's zip archives. For me this looks like <c>C:\xsltproc</c>.</p>

      <p>In this section we install the <c>git</c> version control system and some tools to interact with it, including a fairly full-featured emulation of the <c>bash</c> command line shell. I strongly recommend you use the Git Bash shell or another <c>bash</c> emulation, so that you can use Linux commands referenced elsewhere.</p>
      <p>One feature in particular, <c>pdfcrop</c>, has not been made to work in the normal Windows <c>cmd</c> shell, although the rest of <pretext /> has.

  <section xml:id="installing-anaconda">
    <title>Installing Anaconda</title>
    <p>Anaconda is a well-regulated development environment for Python under Windows, and I recommend it for users who do not already have Python installed. The essential <c>mbx</c> script has <url href="https://github.com/rbeezer/mathbook/pull/252">recently been updated</url> to support both Python 2 and Python 3. Therefore we make no recommendation about which Python version to choose.</p>
    <p>If you already have a working Python installation, skip to <xref ref="installing-imagemagick" />.</p>
    <p>You have some choice with your Anaconda installation. It actually supports the installation of several independent Pythons side-by-side (since both 2.7 and 3.x are in active use, this is more reasonable than it seems). If you do not need Python for anything else or are simply a minimalist, Miniconda is also an option. Miniconda installs no packages, but these can be installed via the <c>conda</c> utility at the command line later.<ol>
      <li><p>Download either Miniconda, Python 2.7, or Python 3.5 from the <url href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Anaconda download page</url>.</p></li>
      <li><p>Run the installer and accept all the default suggestions.</p></li>
    </ol></p>

    <p>Congratulations, you have successfully installed Python.</p>
    <p>If you do not care about images, you can stop here. Much of the MBX functionality is already present. However, to use the <c>mbx</c> script to create SVG images from sources like PDF/PNG images, Sage, Asymptote, or TikZ, you need to install ImageMagick and Ghostscript using the directions in <xref ref ="installing-imagemagick" /> and <xref ref ="installing-ghostscript" />.</p>

If you have a 64-bit Windows installation (<xref ref="do-i-have-64-bit-windows" />), use the recommended version. If you have a 32-bit installation, find the version whose filename is obtained from that of the recommended version by substituting <c>x86</c> for <c>x64</c>. For example, if the recommended version's filename is:</p>
    <pre>ImageMagick-7.0.1-6-Q16-x64-dll.exe</pre>
    <p>then a good choice for a 32-bit Windows would be</p>

    <title>What's Missing</title>
    <p>Development of a Windows-compatible <c>mbx</c> script (<xref ref="mbx-script" />) is mostly complete. If you need help with <c>mbx</c>, contact Dave Rosoff. There are still a few use cases that haven't been tested, mostly those to do with Asymptote.</p>
    <p>At present, it only seems to be possible to install Sage on Windows by way of the Windows Subsystem for Linux, available only in Windows 10.</p>
