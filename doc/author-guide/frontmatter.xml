        <p>This guide will help you <em>author</em> a <pretext /> document.  So it serves as a description of the <pretext /> <init>XML</init> vocabulary, along with the mechanics of creating the source and common output formats.  Note that this is different than <em>publishing</em> your document, which is described in the <pubtitle><pretext /> Publisher's Guide</pubtitle>.  Even if you intend to distribute your document with an open license, and you are both author <em>and</em> publisher, it is still helpful and instructive to understand, and separate, the two different steps and roles.</p>
