    <title>Windows Subsystem for Linux</title>

    <p>With Windows 10 you can install the <term>Windows Subsystem for Linux</term> (<init>WSL</init>).  This is basically Ubuntu Linux (one of the most popular versions of Linux) integrated into Windows 10 in a way that command-line Linux programs can be executed easily.  An early announcement is available at <url href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl" />.  Michael Dood reports on 2016-06-01 that this works quite well for the programs necessary to author with MathBook XML.</p>

    <p>Ubuntu Linux installs new programs using <c>apt</c> via a command such as:</p>

    <console>
        <prompt>rob@lava:~$ </prompt>
        <input>apt-get install xsltproc</input>
    </console>

    <p>Possibly you will need to prefix the above with <c>sudo</c> to gain the right privileges to install new software.</p>

    <p>This short description is far from complete, so feel free to contribute more details.  But Ubuntu and WSL should be well-documented on the Internet, so this should be enough to get you started.</p>
