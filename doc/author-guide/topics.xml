        <title>Verbatim and Literal Text</title>

        <introduction>

            <p>This section expands on parts of <xref ref="overview-verbatim-literal" />.  For descriptions of more involved uses, such as program listings and console sessions, see <xref ref="topic-program-listings" />.</p>

            <p>The tags described here contain <em>only raw characters</em>.  By that we typically mean the first 128 characters of the <acro>ASCII</acro> code.  Unicode characters are likely to migrate to HTML output just fine, but results for <latex /> output will be variable.  The restriction to character data has two consequences.  First, any markup will be silently ignored.  Second, you need to observe the rules on special characters and escaped characters for <init>XML</init>, which are mercifully simple.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>In your source, use <c>&amp;amp;</c> for an <ampersand />, and use <c>&amp;lt;</c> and <c>&amp;gt;</c> for <less /> and <greater />.  Otherwise, every other <acro>ASCII</acro> character will render faithfully across all possible formats.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </introduction>

        <subsection xml:id="short-verbatim-text">
            <title>Short, Inline, Verbatim Text</title>

            <p>The <tag>c</tag> is a mnemonic for <q>code</q>, but is really meant to be any chunk of literal characters that you want to emphasise that way.  It is meant for use within a sentence or caption (<q>inline</q>) so its use is limited to those situations, and others that are similar, such as a title or a cell of a table.  Typically these pieces of text do not break across lines, so can bleed into right margins, or cause very short lines.  So keep the content short, and/or use early in the first sentence of a paragraph where you know it will not affect a line break.  For longer chunks, see options following.</p>

            <p>Typical presentation is a monospace font, perhaps of a slightly heavier weight.</p>

            <p>There is two caveats for use when creating <latex /> output.  We have chosen to use the <c>?</c> character as a delimiter for the start and end of a run of verbatim text.  Unfortunately, such a choice is necessary.  But if your run of characters includes a question mark, then the run will end prematurely.  So we have an attribute, <attribute>latexsep</attribute> that can be set to some other character, such as <c>!</c> or <c>|</c>, that does not appear in your content.  This choice has no effect on other output formats.</p>

            <p>The other caveat for <latex /> output is that you may use the <tag>c</tag> tag within a <tag>title</tag>, but you should avoid <latex />'s special characters (such as <c>\</c>, <c>#</c>, etc.).  Regular characters should migrate to titles as verbatim text just fine, but we do not guarantee all possibilities.</p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="long-verbatim-text">
            <title>Longer, Inline, Verbatim Text</title>

            <p>For longer pieces of verbatim text, use the <tag>cd</tag> tag, which is short for <q>code display</q>, analogous to the <tag>md</tag> for mathematics.  It is used within sentences of a paragraph and will be presented with a vertical break above and below, but without interrupting the paragraph.  Because of the display presentation, it cannot be used other places, such as a <tag>title</tag>, where a vertical gap is not appropriate.  All of the previous discussion about special characters applies for this tag.</p>

            <p>You have two options in use.  You may author inline with the rest of a sentence, with no extra newlines or whitespace before, after, or within the content.  The result will be a single displayed line.</p>

            <p>Or you may structure the content using one, or more, of the <tag>cline</tag> tag, which is meant to be similar to the <tag>line</tag> tag used elsewhere.  You should still take care to not place any extra whitespace before or after the <tag>cd</tag> element, but inbetween the <tag>cline</tag> you may use as much visual formatting of your source as you wish, especially if you like your source to mirror your output.  For <latex /> output there is less danger that your content will inadvertenly end the verbatim text prematurely.</p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="block-verbatim-text">
            <title>Blocks of Verbatim Text</title>

            <p>If you want to isolate large chunks of verbatim text outside of paragraphs, the <tag>pre</tag> tag is the one to use.  It can be used as a peer of paragraphs (and other structures) as a child of a subdivision, or it can be placed into a <tag>listing</tag> to receive a caption, title and number.</p>

            <p>You can structure the contents with <tag>cline</tag> in exactly the same manner as for <tag>cd</tag>.  But you may find this tedious.  Instead, you can make the content of <tag>pre</tag> a sequence of lines separated by newlines.  So that you can preserve the indentation of your source, the line closest to the left margin is taken to actually be the left margin, and a corresponding amount of leading whitespace will be removed from every line.  This will work well if you recognize two caveats.  First, results will be unpredictable if you mix spaces and tabs for indentation.  Sticking with spaces is best.  Second, if your first characters of content immediately follow the <tag>pre</tag> tag then there is no leading whitespace and it is as if that line is already at the left margin.  Then subsequent indentation may seem too severe to you.</p>

            <p>As previously mentioned, <xref ref="topic-program-listings" /> discusses the <tag>console</tag> and <tag>program</tag> tags which are more specific, and hence more capable.  Review the possibilities before you decide between <tag>pre</tag>, <tag>console</tag>, and <tag>program</tag>.</p>

    <section xml:id="topic-cross-referencing">
        <title>Cross-References and Citations</title>

        <p>When you read a novel, you would likely read it cover-to-cover (in one sitting?) and then put it away and never read it again.  But for a textbook, you may read cover-to-cover, but you may also frequently skip around, especially at exam time.  And once read, it might become a reference work for you, since you know it so well.  So years later you might come back looking for something.  Cross-references help with all this, so use them liberally.  Recognize that an index is really just a specialized way to provide an abundance of cross-references.</p>

        <p>It is a two-step process to make a cross-reference.<ol>
            <li>Put an <attribute>xml:id</attribute> attribute on any element you think you might want to reference later.  Be organized about the values of these attributes, and in particular do not number them, as this has no place in your source, and you do not want to maintain the changing numbers over the life of your project.  See the advice in <xref ref="overview-cross-references" /> about banned characters.  Some elements do not accept this attribute because the element has nothing to identify it (no number, no title).  Typically these are <term>containers</term> like <tag>sidebyside</tag> or <tag>statement</tag>.  In these cases, put the attribute on the closest enclosing element.</li>

            <li>To make a cross reference, you create an <tage>xref</tage> element with a <attribute>ref</attribute> attribute with the same value as <attribute>xml:id</attribute> attribute on the element you want to reference.</li>
        </ol>Simple.  It is meant to be, so you can use it liberally.  But we also know authors want some flexibility.</p>

        <p>By default, a cross-reference will visually be text like Theorem 5.2.  Depending on your output format, it may have various devices to help you locate that theorem.  Maybe a page number, or it is a hyperlink, or the whole theorem is the content of a knowl.  You can change the default look of cross-references by setting the <attribute>text</attribute> attribute in <c>docinfo/cross-references</c>.  But you can also change the visual appearance of a cross-reference on a case-by-case basis.  Add a <attribute>text</attribute> attribute to your <tage>xref</tage> element to override the document-wide setting.  The first column of this table lists the possible attribute values, either document-wide, or on a per-cross-reference basis.  The second column has live cross-references to a section of an earlier chapter (that is far away).  The third column has live cross-references to another section of this chapter (which is close by).  For the fourth column, we have placed content (<q>Extra</q>) into the <tag>xref</tag> element as an override of, or addition to, some of the text for the cross-references of the preceding column.  Study the table and then read some more explanation following.  Note that <c>type-hybrid</c> is the default.</p>

        <p>Note that <c>local/global</c> describes the uniqueness of the number (and is affected by your choice of numbering schemes), while <c>type</c> refers to an automatic prefix of the number.  The text of the type will vary according to the document's language. If a cross-reference and its target are close to each other, a number like 5.8.2.4 might be overkill, when just a 4 would suffice.  A <c>hybrid</c> scheme will use the shorter number whenever it makes sense.  Finally, there are two <c>phrase</c> schemes, and it should be clear what text <c>title</c> will produce (though realize there must be a title for the object, possibly a default provided by <pretext />).</p>

        <p>You can also override the text used in a cross-reference link.  You do this by providing content to the <tag>xref</tag> element.  In other words, do not use an empty tag, but put some (simple) text in the element.  Generally, this additional text becomes a prefix of a number, a replacement of a type, or a replacement of a title.  It is better to use these overrides, since in electronic formats, the text of the override will be incorporated into the <q>clickable</q> portion of the resulting link, making a larger item to hit.</p>

        <p>Here are careful examples, where we have provided the content <q>Division</q> in the live examples.  The list is not exhaustive.  Note that overriding a title provides a way to provide any text you would like.</p>

        <p>Citations, which are cross-references to <tag>biblio</tag> elements behave the same way, but will always visually look like [23].  References to equations (<tag>men</tag> and <tag>mrow</tag> elements) will visually look like (4.2), where the type is implied by the parentheses.  Notice that you cannot cross-reference an <tag>me</tag> (no number) or <tag>md</tag> (just a container).</p>

        <p>Further, there are some variant formats.<ul>
            <li>Replace <attribute>ref</attribute> by <attribute>provisional</attribute> and give it a value with some simple text like <c>subsection on eagle habitat</c> and you will get reminders that once you write this future subsection you need to link it in right here.  This is just a convenience for authors during the early stages of a writing project.</li>

            <li>Replace <attribute>ref</attribute> by the pair <attribute>first</attribute> and <attribute>last</attribute>.  Provide attribute values just as you would for <attribute>ref</attribute>.  The code will check that the targets have the exact same tag, and that the order is correct.  You will get a link that looks like a range, separated by an en-dash.  As a link, only <attribute>first</attribute> will be used for the linking mechanism (<ie />, one link is generated, not two).  Experiment with <attribute>text</attribute> and content overrides.</li>

            <li>The <attribute>ref</attribute> attribute may be a list of <attribute>xml:id</attribute>, separated by commas or by spaces.  Then you will get back a list of cross-references.  This is meant for a list of citations, producing a look like [5, 9, 22], but it makes no restriction to this case.  Use it generally, but it is unlikely to get any more capable.  If you want a different list, just use multiple <tag>xref</tag> and format as you desire.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>You can create many different combinations with the text options and the variants.  Here is one example.  You want to say <xref first="start-here" last="schema" text="global">Chapters</xref>.  As a range you use the variant with two references. You would get <q>Chapter</q> out front automatically with the <c>type-global</c> scheme, but a plural form makes more sense.  So you use that text as an override.  We could use either <c>type-global</c> or <c>global</c> to get the same text, and possibly <c>type-hybrid</c> depending on teh place where you built the cross-reference.  So possibly, one of these schemes might be your document-wide setting and you do not need to specify it now.  Here is what we just used:<cd>
            <cline>&lt;xref first="start-here" last="schema" text="global"&gt;Chapters&lt;/xref&gt;</cline>
        </cd></p>

        <p>Finally, there is fairly robust error-checking to protect against typographical errors in the attribute values that need to match up for all this to work.  Also, there is a check that the <attribute>xml:id</attribute> are unique.  But all this checking happens at processing-time, not at the validation step.  Any suggestions for improvements that make these checks even more robust are welcome.</p>

        <note>
            <title>Best Practices</title>

            <p>With numbering schemes for divisions, theorems, figures, equations, and citations, along with nine different text styles, plus variants, per-cross-reference settings, and text overrides, there are a lot of combinations.  Likely you can create some fairly ugly cross-references.  Use the flexibility sensibly.</p>

    <section xml:id="topic-subdivisions">
        <title>Subdivisions</title>

        <p>A <term>subdivision</term> is a structured component of a book or article that would be recognized by most any reader.  They are essential to the organization of a MathBook XML project.  Notice that we use the generic term subdivision, since a <tag>section</tag> is just one example of a subdivision.</p>

        <p>Subdivisions are <tag>book</tag>, <tag>article</tag>, <tag>part</tag>, <tag>chapter</tag>, <tag>section</tag>, <tag>subsection</tag>, <tag>subsubsection</tag>, and <tag>paragraphs</tag>.  Their use is fairly intuitive, though there are some restrictions, so please read on.</p>

        <p>A <tag>book</tag> must contain at least one <tag>chapter</tag>, which may contain <tag>section</tag>, <tag>subsection</tag>, and <tag>subsubsection</tag>.  The tag <tag>part</tag> is planned for books, between <tag>book</tag> and <tag>chapter</tag>.  It will function in two user-selectable ways: structural (<eg /> numbering will reset), or decorative (merely inserting a decorative page between two chapters and sectioning the Table of Contents).</p>

        <p>An <tag>article</tag> is simpler and shorter than a book.  It might be really simple and have no subdivisions at all, or it may have <tag>section</tag>s.  It cannot have <tag>chapter</tag>s, as that would be a <tag>book</tag>.  Within a <tag>section</tag>, <tag>subsection</tag>s and <tag>subsubsection</tag>s may follow.</p>

        <p>Subdivisions must nest properly and may not be skipped.  So a <tag>section</tag> cannot contain a <tag>chapter</tag> and a <tag>subsection</tag> may not be contained in a <tag>chapter</tag> without an intervening <tag>section</tag>.</p>

        <p>A subdivision <em>must</em> contain a <tag>title</tag>, and may contain one or more index entries (see <xref provisional="topic-index" />), which should appear before anything else.  Any subdivision may be unstructured, with just a sequence of <term>top-level content</term> such as paragraphs, figures, lists, theorems, <etc />  Or a subdivision may be structured, and in this case it must follow a prescribed pattern.  There may be a single, optional <tag>introduction</tag>, filled with top-level content, followed by a sequence of at least one of the appropriate subdivisions, ending with a single, optional <tag>conclusion</tag>, filled with top-level content.  It is an error to begin with a run of top-level content inside a subdivision and then begin to use subdivisions.  (The solution is to make the initial content an <tag>introduction</tag> and/or one or several subdivisions.)</p>

        <p>There are exceptions to the above.  For one, <tag>paragraphs</tag> is an anomalous subdivision, as a sort of lightweight sectioning command.  It may appear in any subdivision, at any location within a subdivision, it may not be subdivided further (it is a leaf of the document tree), it never gets a number, and its title is formatted in a subsidiary way.  I especially like to use this in a two- or three-page <tag>article</tag> that has no other subdivisions at all.  Typical presentation has the title in bold, without much change in font size (if at all), inline with the first paragraph, and perhaps a bit of vertical space as it begins and ends.  Despite the name, it may contain more than just paragaphs, so may contain any top-level-content that would go in any other subdivision.</p>

        <p>Two other anomalous subdivisions are <tag>exercises</tag> and <tag>references</tag>.  These can function as a further subdivision of any other subdivision.  So for example, an <tag>exercises</tag> could be a peer of several <tag>section</tag>s, contained within a structured <tag>chapter</tag>, and in this case would behave like the other <tag>section</tag>s with regard to numbering and presentation.  Detail on allowed content and its behavior are in <xref ref="topic-exercises" /> and <xref ref="topic-references" />, respectively.</p>

            <title>Punctuation After Display Math</title>

            <p>If a chunk of displayed math concludes a sentence, then the sentence-ending punctuation should appear at the conclusion of the display.  (And certainly not at the start of the first line after the display!)  But do not author the punctuation within the mathematics element, put it afterwards, where it logically belongs.</p>

            <p>More specifically, place a sentence-ending period (say) <em>immediately</em> after the closing of an <tag>me</tag>, <tag>men</tag>, <tag>md</tag>, or <tag>mdn</tag> element. MathBook XML will place the period in your output in the right place and in the right way.  (By using <latex />'s <c>\text{}</c> macro, if you are curious to know the details.)  Here is an example.  The <init>XML</init> source<cd>
                <cline>&lt;md&gt;</cline>
                <cline>    &lt;mrow&gt;(a+b)^2&lt;/mrow&gt;</cline>
                <cline>&lt;/md&gt;.  Now...</cline>
            </cd>will render as<md>
                <mrow>(a+b)^2</mrow>
            </md>.  Now<ellipsis /></p>

            <p>Take notice of the requirement that the punctuation must be <em>immediately</em> after the closing tag of the math element, otherwise it will not migrate properly.</p>

            <title>Raster Images</title>

            <p>A <term>raster image</term> is an image described pixel-by-pixel, with different colors and intensities.  Photographs are good examples.  Common formats are Portable Network Graphics (PNG) and Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG, JPG), which will both work with <c>pdflatex</c> and modern browsers.  JPEG are a good choice for photographics since they are compressed on the assumption they will be viewed by a human, while PNG is a lossless format and good for line art, diagrams and similar images (if you do not have vector graphics versions, see below).</p>

            <p>To use these images, you simply provide the filename, with a relative path.  A subdirectory such as <c>images</c> is a good choice for a place to put them.  It is your responsibility to place these images where the <latex /> output will find them or where the HTML output will find them.  The XML would look like:</p>

            <pre>
            <![CDATA[<image source="images/crocodiles.png" width="50%" />]]>
            </pre>

            <p>Typically you would wrap this in a <tag>figure</tag> that might have an <attribute>xml:id</attribute> attribute for cross-references, with or without a caption.  There is no <attribute>height</attribute> attribute, so the aspect ratio of your image is your responsibility outside of MathBook XML.  The <attribute>width</attribute> attribute is a percentage of the available width of the text (outside of a <tag>sidebyside</tag> panel).  Default width is typically 90<percent />.</p>

            <p>You may also provide a <tag>description</tag> which will aid accessibility for electronic formats.  Keep such readers in mind and provide as much description as possible.  Keep the markup simple, since this will typically migrate to an HTML attribute that cannot contain any structure.  Be careful to avoid double-quotes.  For example,</p>

            <pre>
            <![CDATA[
            <image source="images/crocodiles.jpeg" width="50%">
                <description>Five crocodiles partially submerged in the shallows.</description>
            </image>

        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="topic-images-vector">
            <title>Vector Graphics</title>

            <p>An image is a <term>vector graphic</term> if the file describes the geometric shapes that constitute the image.  So a simple diagram would be a good candidate, but a photograph would not.  Popular formats are Portable Document Format (PDF) and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).  You will get the best results with PDF images in <latex /> output and SVG images for HTML.  The principal advantage of these formats is that they scale (big or small) smoothly, along with fonts.  This is critical when you cannot predict the screen size for a reader of an electronic version.</p>

            <p>Unless you describe these images with a language (see next subsection), you are responsible for providing the PDF and SVG versions.  The <c>pdf2svg</c> utility is very useful if you have PDF images only.  To use these images, you simply follow the instructions above, but do not include a file extension.  This alerts the conversion to use the best possible choice.  So presuming we had files <c>images/toad-life-cycle.pdf</c> and <c>images/toad-life-cycle.svg</c>, an example would be:</p>

            <pre>
            <![CDATA[
            <image source="images/toad-life-cycle" width="85%">
                <description>Diagram of the four stages of a toad's life.</description>

            <title>Image Archives</title>

            <p>As an instructor, you might want to recycle images from a text for a classroom presentation, a project handout, or an examination question.  As an author, you can elect to make images files available through links in the HTML version, and it is easy and flexible to produce those links automatically.</p>

            <p>First, it is your responsibility to manufacture the files.  For making different formats, the <c>mbx</c> script can sometimes help (<xref ref="mbx-script" />).  The Image Magick <c>convert</c> command is a quick way to make raster images in different formats, while the <c>pdf2svg</c> executable is good for converting vector graphics <init>PDF</init>s into <init>SVG</init>s.  Also, to make this easy to specify, different versions of the same image must have identical paths and names, other than the suffixes.  Finally, the case and spelling of the suffix in your <init>MBX</init> source must match the filename (<eg /> <c>jpg</c> versus <c>JPEG</c>).  OK, those are the ground rules.</p>

            <p>For links for a single image, add the <attribute>archive</attribute> attribute to the <tag>image</tag> element, such as<cd>
                <cline>&lt;image  ...  archive="pdf svg"&gt;</cline>
            </cd>to get two links for a single image.</p>

            <p>To have every single image receive an identical collection of links, in <c>docinfo/images</c> place an <tag>archive</tag> element whose content is the space-separated list of suffixes/formats.<cd>
                <cline>&lt;archive&gt;png JPEG tex ods&lt;/archive&gt;</cline>
            </cd>will provide four links on every image, including a link to an OpenDocument spreadsheet.</p>

            <p>For a collection of images that is contained within some portion of your document, you can place an <attribute>@xml:id</attribute> on the enclosing element and then in <c>docinfo/images</c> place<cd>
                <cline>&lt;archive from="the-xml-id-on-the-portion"&gt;svg png&lt;/archive&gt;</cline>
            </cd>to get two links on every image <em>only</em> in that portion (chapter, subsection, side-by-side, <etc />).  The <attribute>from</attribute> attribute is meant to suggest the root of a subtree of your hierarchical document.  If you use this, then <em>do not</em> use the global form that does not have <attribute>from</attribute>.</p>

            <p>You may accumulate several of the above semi-global semi-local forms in succession.  An image will receive links according to the last <tag>archive</tag> whose <attribute>from</attribute> subtree contains the image.  So the strategy is to place general, large subtree, specifications early, and use refined, smaller subtree specifications later.  For example,<cd>
                <cline>&lt;archive from="the-xml:id-on-a-chapter"&gt;svg png&lt;/archive&gt;</cline>
                <cline>&lt;archive from="the-xml:id-on-the-introduction"&gt;jpeg&lt;/archive&gt;</cline>
                <cline>&lt;archive from="the-xml:id-on-a-section-within" /&gt;</cline>
            </cd>will put two links on every image of a chapter, but just one link on images in the introduction, and no links at all on every image image within one specific section.  Again, do not mix with the global form.  You can use the root document node (<eg /> <tag>book</tag>) for <attribute>from</attribute> to obtain a global treatment, but it is unnecessary (and inefficient) to provide empty content for the root node as first in the list<mdash />the same effect is the default behavior.</p>

            <p>Notice that this facility does not restrict you to providing files of the same image, or even images at all.  You could choose to make data files available for each data plot you provide, as spreadsheets, or text files, or whatever you have, or whatever you think your readers need.</p>

            <p>Finally, <q>archive</q> may be a bit of a misnomer, since there is no historical aspect to any of this.  Maybe <q>repository</q> would be more accurate.  Though for a history textbook, it might be a perfect name.</p>

        <title><init>URL</init>s and External References</title>

        <subsection>
            <title><init>URL</init>s to External Web Pages</title>

            <p>The <tag>url</tag> tag can be used to point to external items (as distinct from other portions of your current document, which is accomplished with the <tage>xref</tage> element, <xref ref="overview-cross-references" />).  It always needs a value for the <attribute>href</attribute> attribute, most likely a <init>URL</init>.  Most of this time, this will point to some resource available on the Internet but it could be a file on the system hosting your document, perhaps using a relative address (but see the rest of this section for some cautions).  Here are three scenarios:<ul>
                <li><p>The <tag>url</tag> element is empty.  Then the value of the <attribute>href</attribute> is also used for the visible text of the link, verbatim, and usually in a monospace font.  Use <term>percent-encoding</term> (aka <term>URL encoding</term>) for the <attribute>href</attribute> attribute to include special characters, such as spaces.</p></li>

                <li><p>The <tag>url</tag> element has content.  Now the content should be authored as you would any other text in a sentence.  Potentially problematic characters, such as a tilde should be authored with provided empty elements, but authored literally in the <attribute>href</attribute> attribute.</p></li>

                <li><p>The <tag>url</tag> element has content, but you want this content to look like a <init>URL</init>.  Use the <tag>c</tag> element around the content, and follow the rules for verbatim text.  I do this often for simple <init>URL</init>s that point to the top level of a website.  The <attribute>href</attribute> is a complete <init>URL</init> like <c>http://mathbook.pugetsound.edu/</c> but for content I use a less-imposing reader-friendly version like <c>mathbook.pugetsound.edu</c>.</p></li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>For <latex /> output it gets quite tricky to handle all the various meanings of certain escape characters in <init>URL</init>s in more complicated contexts (such as tables, footnotes, and titles), so there may be some special cases where the formatting is off or you get an error when compiling your <latex />.  We handle most of these situations, but we always appreciate reports of missed cases.</p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="topic-external-data-file">
            <title><init>URL</init>s to External Data Files</title>

            <p>The <tag>url</tag> element can be used to make data files available to your reader.  Consider the example of a spreadsheet containing a large data set that a reader needs to analyze as part of an exercise.  Here are our recommendations on how to accomplish this:<ul>
                <li><p>If the file is hosted on some server unassociated with your project, and does not have a license compatible with your project, then just set the <attribute>href</attribute> to the complete address.  Be sure to include enough of the address for the reader of a a print version to be able to type in the <init>URL</init>, either as the content of the <tag>url</tag> or in close vicinity.</p></li>

                <li><p>If you authored the spreadsheet, or you are allowed to legally copy and distribute it, then place it on your server where you host your book project.  Then do as above and use the full <init>URL</init> for the <attribute>href</attribute> attribute, with a visible version available for <init>PDF</init> and print versions.</p></li>

                <li><p>If you have control over the placement of the file, you can host it on your server, and use a <init>URL</init> relative to the location of your <init>HTML</init>, <init>PDF</init>, or other files that comprise your document.  This might be a good choice if your book will be posted many places and you can give it to others as an archive, like a <c>*.zip</c> file.  It is a bad idea if a reader downloads a PDF without the data file following along and remaining in the same relative location.  It is an impossible idea if your document gets printed on paper and there is no idea what a relative <init>URL</init> means and there is not even a link to click on.</p></li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>Consider your audience and think about how much guidance they need about using context menus or helper/viewer applications to make use of the file formats you are providing. This advice may be different depending on the type of files and the types of output for your document.</p>

        <title>Unicode Characters</title>

        <introduction>

            <p>MathBook XML supports (and encourages) the use of Unicode characters.  Here are some relevant comments.<ul>
                <li><p>Unicode characters will migrate well to any output format based on <init>HTML</init>.  Most browsers will have a variety of fonts with glyphs to realize these characters.</p></li>

                <li><p><latex /> will not always behave as smoothly.  For openers, you definitely will want to use the <c>xelatex</c> engine to build a <init>PDF</init>.  Then you need to be sure your system has a font with the necessary characters and you make the font known to <c>xelatex</c>.  We are working out the details of the best way to accomplish this.</p></li>

                <li><p>How do you get a Unicode character into your source?  In part this is specific to your operating system and editor, so is outside the scope of this guide, but we have hints below for popular operating systems.</p></li>

                <li><p>You can always place a Unicode character in your source using <init>XML</init> syntax.  The first thing an <init>XML</init> parser will do is convert this syntax into a character.  The number of the <c>SECTION SIGN</c> in hexadecimal is <c>A7</c>, so the syntax <c>&amp;#xA7;</c> is identical to the  character &#xA7;.  Of course, this will get tedious fast.</p></li>

                <li><p>The <url href="https://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/fui.html8">Full Unicode Input</url> utility at <c>www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/fui.html8</c> will allow you to specify a chunk of 256 consecutive Unicode numbers and then you can click on characters to make a string of several or many.  You can cut/paste these into your source, or convert the whole lot to <init>XML</init> syntax all at once.</p></li>

                <li><p>Unicode characters have standardized names.  You can find these, and more information, including font support, at the Unicode section of <url href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/">FileFormat.info</url>, <c>www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/</c>.  If you are struggling to find a specific character, then using this site's name in a search will often quickly locate what you need.  Be sure to experiment with the test pages there for browser and font support (including checking your local configuration).</p></li>

                <li>
                    <p><alert>Warning</alert>: do not use Unicode characters as a way to get mathematical symbols (that is delegated to our use of <latex /> syntax).  And do not use Unicode when we have provided an empty element for a character, especially when that character may be used in a markup syntax for some output, such as <latex />, <init>HTML</init>, <init>JSON</init>, Markdown, <ellipsis /></p>

                    <p>For example, if you put many naked hash symbols (<hash />) in your source, then you will get nice <init>HTML</init>, but when you try to get print from a PDF from <latex /> you will have a train wreck on your hands when you compile the <latex />.  Instead, be sure to always use the provided <c>&lt;hash /&gt;</c> element.  <em>Always</em>.  Other empty elements are conveniences, which spare you from looking up Unicode numbers and make your source more readable, rather than a necessity to avoid special characters.  An example is <c>&lt;times /&gt;</c>, for use outside of a strictly mathematical setting:  <q>I bought a 2<times />4 at the lumberyard.</q></p>
                </li>
            </ul></p>

            <title>Unicode Support in OSX</title>

            <p>Mitch Keller reports on 2017-01-12 a way to get some popular characters with OSX.  Use the Keyboard preference pane under System Preferences. In there, you can enable <cd>
                <cline>Show Keyboard, Emoji, &amp; Symbols Viewers in menu bar</cline>
            </cd>Once you activate the keyboard viewer, you get a keyboard on your screen. When you hold down <c>opt</c>, it shows you what other symbol you would get if you push <c>opt+letter</c>. For instance, <c>opt+w</c> gives an upper-case Greek sigma and <c>opt+=</c> gives a not-equals sign (neither of which we can handle when processing the latex version of this guide). To get ä, you type <c>opt+u</c> and then hit <c>a</c>. This is illustrated by the keys for diacritical marks being highlighted in orange while holding opt.  The shift key can have an effect to produce variations of some characters, such as quote marks (dumb versus smart).</p>

        <title>Xinclude Modularization</title>

        <p>The <c>xinclude</c> mechanism is not part of <pretext />, <foreign>per se</foreign>.  It is of some use for organizing your work, so you do not have mammoth files open in your editor.  As discussed in <xref ref="processing-modular" /> there is very little value in modularizing so much that you have many very small files, and also almost no benefit whatsoever to using directory structure to duplicate the inherent tree-like structure of <init>XML</init>.</p>

        <p>The <c>xinclude</c> mechanism automatically introduces a <attribute>xml:base</attribute> attribute, which we need to account for in the RELAX-NG schema (<xref ref="schema" />).  So we limit which <pretext /> elements may be the root element of an included file.  The rough, general rule is that if an element <em>can</em> have a title, then it can be the root element of an included file.  So in particular all the divisions (<tag>chapter</tag>, <tag>section</tag>, <etc />) are all candidates.</p>

        <p>One special exception to this restriction is the use of text files, containing absolutely no markup at all.  Two good examples are the <tag>input</tag> child of a <tag>program</tag> or the <tag>latex-image-code</tag> element used to describe an <tag>image</tag> by source code that <latex /> understands.</p>

        <p>In both cases you can put the text content of these elements in a separate file, use the <attribute>href</attribute> attribute of <tag>xi:include</tag> to point to the file, and then the twist is to set the <attribute>parse</attribute> attribute to the value <c>text</c>.  This has two general benefits.  First, you now <em>cannot</em> have any <init>XML</init> in the file, so you do not have to have a single root element for the file (and so the schema imposes no restrictions).  Second, you do not need to escape any problematic characters like ampersands and angle brackets (<xref ref="topic-verbatim-literal" />), nor use the misunderstood <c>CDATA</c> mechanism.</p>

        <p>Additionally, in the case of <tag>latex-image-code</tag> you can park unsightly code away in files so you do not have to look at it, or you can create a small driver <latex /> program to test each one, or even better, you may want to use the same image more than once (maybe in different figures?) and can just include it repeatedly.</p>

        <p>Finally, the <tag>input</tag> and <tag>output</tag> children of <tag>program</tag>, <tag>sage</tag>, and <tag>console</tag> are also candidates for this device.  In particular, you may want to have the code for a program in its own file where you can test it easily with an interpreter or compiler.  There is one gotcha.  If you were to put a newline between <tag>input</tag> and <tag>xi:include</tag> there is the very real potential of unwanted whitespace bleeding into your <pretext /> output.  Our suggested remedy uses an example from Bob Plantz.  Convert</p>

        <pre>
        &lt;program language="c">
            &lt;input>
                &lt;xi:include parse="text" href="intAndFloat.c"/>
            &lt;/input>
        &lt;/program>
