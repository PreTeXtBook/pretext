    <title>Copyright and Licensing</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>The legal issues described here are based on the authors' experiences and study, which necessarily reflect the laws of the United States.  But the <url href="">Berne Convention</url>, which dates to 1886, has 172 parties, so law and practice are very similar the world over.  The United States acceded to the convention in 1988.</p>
    </introduction>

    <section>
        <title>Copyright</title>

        <p><term>Copyright</term> is a monopoly granted by the government.  It gives the author control over reproductions, translations, adaptations, performances, communications, <etc /> of their work for a fixed time.  Since 1978, it has not been necessary to register a copyright<mdash />it is automatic.  So for example, every web page, no matter how simple or unrefined, is copyrighted by its author.</p>

        <p>The phrase <q>All Rights Reserved</q> is used to assert that the copyright holder intends to exercise all the rights granted by copyright.  It is not required to mark a document with the copyright symbol (<copyright />) but in case of disputes, it can be helpful.</p>

        <p>So in <pretext /> you can go<cd>
            <cline>&lt;frontmatter&gt;</cline>
            <cline>  &lt;colophon&gt;</cline>
            <cline>    &lt;copyright&gt;</cline>
            <cline>      &lt;holder&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/holder&gt;</cline>
            <cline>      &lt;year&gt;1776&lt;/year&gt;</cline>
            <cline>      &lt;minilicense&gt;All Rights Reserved&lt;/minilicense&gt;</cline>
            <cline>    &lt;/copyright&gt;</cline>
            <cline>  &lt;/colophon&gt;</cline>
            <cline>&lt;/frontmatter&gt;</cline>
        </cd>to assert a <q>traditional</q> copyright and the recommended information will then appear on the page after the title page.</p>

        <p>In academic publishing, authors have usually transferred, or sold, their copyright to a publisher in return for distribution of their work, or for the promise of financial gain.</p>

    <section>
        <title>Open Licenses</title>

        <p>Copyright allows an author to place a license on their work, granting others greater freedoms, sometimes along with certain specific obligations.  So it is important to understand that copyright allows an author or publisher to be very restrictive, and it also allows an author or publisher to be less restrictive.  A license makes these less restrictive terms explicit, and the ability to control these terms is made possible by copyright.</p>

        <p>Generally an open license allows unlimited copying.  It often allows the creation of derivative works, and the mixing of material from a variety of openly licensed documents.  A <term>viral license</term> obliges the author of a derivative work to grant the same license to the derivative work, rather than asserting more restrictive terms.  The licenses are usually perpetual, so they do not expire at a fixed term.</p>

        <p>It is easy to get distracted by legal jargon, obtuse arguments, and misunderstandings.  We view an open license as statement of intent.  The work is free to use forever.  It will not go out of print.  If you send the author a correction, suggestion, or contribution, it can be incorporated and enjoyed by others freely.  And should an author lose interest in a project, or become unable to continue working on it, another individual may take it up and continue to maintain it.</p>

    <section>
        <title>Creative Commons Licenses</title>

        <p>We describe the Creative Commons (<init>CC</init>) licenses first, since they have various options, which are a convenient way to compartmentalize and describe the features of other open licenses.  They are known by abbreviations, so a license might be shortened to something like just <c>CC BY-SA</c>.</p>

        <list>
            <caption>Creative Commons Options</caption>
            <dl>
                <li>
                    <title>Creative Commons, <c>CC</c></title>
                    <p>All Creative Commons licenses allows unlimited copying, forever.  Unless restricted, derivative works are allowed with no obligation.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <title>Attribution, <c>BY</c></title>
                    <p>A derivative work must make clear the contribution of the original author.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <title>Share Alike, <c>SA</c></title>
                    <p>A derivative work must be licensed with the same license as the original.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <title>Non-Commercial, <c>NC</c></title>
                    <p>Bans commercial uses.  (Without this clause an open license would allow the sale of copies.)</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <title>No Derivatives, <c>ND</c></title>
                    <p>Derivative works are not allowed.</p>

            <title>Source versus Output</title>

            <p>Creative Commons licenses are designed for a variety of media, and so are very popular.  For example, images are often licensed with a Creative Commons license.</p>

            <p>However, consider the case of a document distributed as a <init>PDF</init> which has been created from source, such as <pretext /> or <latex /> or Markdown.  An author may put a <c>CC BY-SA</c> license on the <init>PDF</init> while retaining traditional copyright on the source file(s).  While the license allows modification, how practical is it to modify a <init>PDF</init>?  Worse, we have seen this situation for projects described as <q>open source.</q>  This explains our use sometimes of the term <q>openly licensed content.</q></p>

            <p>If you are serious about your project being open source, and you want to send that signal to your readers, then mark your output with a <init>CC</init> license <em>and</em> mark your source files as also having the same <init>CC</init> license.  This is usually accomplished by a statement at the top of each source file asserting copyright and then stating the license.  Or this statement can point to a top-level text file, often named <c>COPYING</c> or <c>LICENSE</c>, with more precise license information.  See the <pretext /> distribution for examples using the <init>GPL</init> software license.</p>
        </paragraphs>

        <paragraphs>
            <title>Commercial Consideration</title>

            <p>It is natural to consider that you have devoted considerable time and effort to your project, and with an open license you will now be donating it to the world to read for free.  So you might think, <q>Why should somebody else profit?</q>  Thus, the <c>NC</c> option is alluring.  But think about it for a minute.</p>

            <p>Suppose a commercial publisher hires an experienced copy editor to go through your book, correcting errors and tightening the prose.  Then the publisher prints the improved version of your book in a nice hardback version, and sells the book for $250.  If you simply put the <c>BY-SA</c> options on your license, that publisher is obligated to (a) give you credit for authoring the original version of the book, and (b) make the copy-edited version available again with a <c>CC BY-SA</c> license.  Now there is a business opportunity for anybody in the world:  make a print-on-demand version of the copy-edited version, and sell it for $200.  Then it is a race to the bottom.  Eventually the price will come down to the cost of manufacturing, plus some small compensation for managing the relationship with a print-on-demand service <xref ref="print-on-demand" />.  Just how much profit potential is there really available for others?</p>

            <p>We assume you have written a book because you have something to say, and chosen an open license because you want to be read.  If you do place an <c>NC</c> option on your <init>CC</init> license, then you have made it impossible for anybody else to help you distribute your book in physical forms.  A <c>CC BY-SA</c> license already makes your work unattractive to a commercial publisher who wants to charge an unreasonable price, and adding an <c>NC</c> clause simply chokes off some distribution options, limiting the reach of your work.</p>

            <p>This discussion is meant to explain why we call it the <q>CC-NC mistake.</q></p>
        </paragraphs>

        <paragraphs>
            <title>Derivative Works</title>

            <p>Will your monograph on the reptiles of the Mongolian steppes ever become a screenplay?  As exciting as the topic is to you, we think Hollywood feels otherwise.  An <c>ND</c> option probably makes little sense for scholarly works.  An conversely, if you get hit by a pie truck tomorrow, it will be a lot easier for an enthusiastic reader to take over custody and maintenance of your project, and they will be <em>required</em> to continue with the same license if you have employed the <c>SA</c> option.</p>
        </paragraphs>

        <p>So in <pretext /> you can go<cd>
            <cline>&lt;frontmatter&gt;</cline>
            <cline>  &lt;colophon&gt;</cline>
            <cline>    &lt;copyright&gt;</cline>
            <cline>      &lt;holder&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/holder&gt;</cline>
            <cline>      &lt;year&gt;1984&lt;/year&gt;</cline>
            <cline>      &lt;minilicense&gt;Creative Commons BY-SA&lt;/minilicense&gt;</cline>
            <cline>    &lt;/copyright&gt;</cline>
            <cline>  &lt;/colophon&gt;</cline>
            <cline>&lt;/frontmatter&gt;</cline>
        </cd>for a <init>CC</init> license with the Attribution and Share-Alike options.  If it was not obvious already, this is our recommendation for scholarly work if you choose to use a Creative Commons license.  This is an example of what is known as a <term>copyleft</term> license.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title><acro>GNU</acro> Free Documentation License</title>

        <p>The <acro>GNU</acro> Free Documentation License (<init>GFDL</init>) is a license designed for documentation of open source computer programs licensed by the <acro>GNU</acro> Public License (<init>GPL</init>).  However, it explicitly mentions textbooks as one possible use.  (<acro>GNU</acro> is a recursive acronym for <q><acro>GNU</acro>'s Not Unix</q> and is the software project that originally built all the utilities which complement the Linux Kernel to make up an operating system.)</p>

        <p>The <init>GFDL</init> is similar to a <c>CC BY-SA</c> license.  It allows unlimited copying, forever.  Modified versions that are distributed must acknowledge the original contributions and must also carry a <init>GFDL</init> license.  So this is a viral license, always.  And another example of copyleft.</p>

        <p>However, the <init>GFDL</init> does not employ options like a Creative Commons license.  More importantly, the <init>GFDL</init> is very explicit about source (<q>transparent</q> copies) and derived output (<q>opaque</q> copies), and the license applies to both versions.  So the <init>GFDL</init> would say <pretext /> source is transparent, and a resulting <init>PDF</init> is opaque, and the license largely treats them identically.</p>

        <p>Because the <init>GFDL</init> has the essential characteristics of <c>CC BY-SA</c>, and is so explicit about simultaneously licensing document source authored with a markup language along with output formats, it is our choice for textbook projects.</p>

        <p>So in <pretext /> we might go something like<cd>
            <cline>&lt;frontmatter&gt;</cline>
            <cline>  &lt;colophon&gt;</cline>
            <cline>    &lt;copyright&gt;</cline>
            <cline>      &lt;holder&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/holder&gt;</cline>
            <cline>      &lt;year&gt;1985&lt;/year&gt;</cline>
            <cline>      &lt;minilicense&gt;GNU Free Documentation License&lt;/minilicense&gt;</cline>
            <cline>    &lt;/copyright&gt;</cline>
            <cline>  &lt;/colophon&gt;</cline>
            <cline>&lt;/frontmatter&gt;</cline>
        </cd>The <init>GFDL</init> is also explicit about including the complete license with your document.  You can find various places a version formatted for inclusion in a <pretext /> project, including as part of the source for this document.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Public Domain</title>

        <p>Stating that your work is in the <term>public domain</term> basically means you relinquish all the rights you receive via your automatic copyright.  So it is a very different situation from using copyright to provide an open license.  Creative Commons uses <c>CC0</c>, <q>No Rights Reserved</q> to indicate this choice.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Remixing and License Compatibility</title>

        <p>It is popular to describe the potential of remixing parts of open educational resources.  For example, a literature professor might collect a variety of openly licensed poems into a reader for students in a course.  When the licenses are viral, and different, there arises the problem of what license to put on the collection.  Worse, one license might prohibit commercial uses, and another allow it, meaning the licenses are incompatible.</p>

        <p>So some thought should go into the choice of a license when the work has the very real potential to be included in another, such as would be the case with a photograph.  One solution is to provide more than one license (nothing about copyright prohibits this).  Another solution is to avoid licenses with overly restrictive terms, such as restricting commercial use or derivative works.</p>

        <p>Remember too, that in addition to multiple licenses, as the copyright holder you may offer your work to another project on different terms.  So another author might ask if a chapter of your work may be included in their project, which might use a different license than yours (more or less restrictive), and yu can grant permission for that use under that license.  Now there are two versions of your chapter, which could diverge over time if derivatives are allowed, available to others on different terms.</p>

        <p>For mathematics books, we do not concern ourselves too much with the potential for remixing.  Notation and dependencies make it hard to collect parts of various textbooks and assemble them into something new (and coherent).</p>

        <p>Creative Commons maintains a matrix showing compatibility between their own licenses at their <init>FAQ</init> question, <url href="https://creativecommons.org/faq/#can-i-combine-material-under-different-creative-commons-licenses-in-my-work">Can I combine material under different Creative Commons licenses in my work?</url>, illustrating just how complicated this can become.</p>

        <p>Finally, recognize that you can begin with a restrictive license and as you become more comfortable with the idea, change it to a more liberal license that applies to the work at the time of the change.  Further, you can always change your license to a more restrictive version, but invariably, you cannot revoke an open license once granted.  You could even stop offering an open license all together, and return to traditional copyright as you continue to improve your document.  But the version that existed when you made that decision is still available for anyone to use, and possibly improve, independent of your own closed version.</p>

        <p>After a while, you realize that openly licensing your writing project gives it an independence and freedom all of its own.  It seems to be owned by everybody, and by nobody<mdash />at the same time.</p>

        <title>A Final Comment</title>

        <p>These discussions remind us of a <url href="http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/presidents/thomas-jefferson/letters-of-thomas-jefferson/jefl220.php">letter by Thomas Jefferson</url>, the principal author of the United States' <pubtitle>Declaration of Independence</pubtitle>, writing about another monoply granted by governments<mdash />patents.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation.</p>
