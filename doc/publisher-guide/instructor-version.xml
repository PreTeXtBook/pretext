    <title>Instructor's Version</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>Once your content is in place, you can begin thinking about various useful derivative versions.  A natural example for a textbook is an <q>Instructor's Version</q>, enhanced with additional material to help an instructor understand your organization and intent, or to provide advice and counsel about teaching the material.</p>
    </introduction>

    <section xml:id="instructor-solutions">
        <title>Solutions</title>

        <p>Philosophies about the purpose and use of exercises varies among authors and instructors.  Some think hints, answers, and/or solutions, should be universally available to students to use responsibly.  Others like to assign exercises to be graded as part of a course grade.  Some are resigned to solutions that are distributed in a limited fashion eventually becoming public, or that some groups of students will distribute their own solutions, possibly not uniformly.  Wherever you place yourself in this debate, distributing solutions to only instructors is one approach, and some instructors may find this a very helpful aid when they teach material new to them.</p>

        <p>There is flexibility in which of <tag>hint</tag>, <tag>answer</tag>, and <tag>solution</tag> can be included or excluded in your text, which can be included or excluded in an Instructor's Version, and which can be included or excluded in a Solution Manual (see <xref ref="solution-manual"/>).  You can choose to author these or not, and then decide which to include in the student version, and which to include in an independently-produced Instructor Version, and which to include in a Solution Manual.</p>

        <p>Read <xref ref="private-solutions"/> for some practical advice about limiting distribution of solutions.</p>

        <title>Notes and Commentary</title>

        <p>The <tag>commentary</tag> element is designed primarily for the purpose of adding material to a document to make an enhanced version.  It is similar in many ways to a <tag>paragraphs</tag> in that it can be placed within any division and must be titled.  The main difference is that it is not displayed by default, so you must set a processing switch to enable its appearance:<cd>
                <cline>xsltproc -stringparam commentary yes ...</cline>
        </cd>Other distinctions are:<ul>
            <li>Since it is elective, you need to be careful about cross-references to and from a <tag>commentary</tag>.  It is highly likely that you will want to make cross-references <em>within</em> a <tag>commentary</tag> <em>pointing to</em> other portions of your text, and this is always a good idea.  You will want to avoid making cross-references <em>to</em> a <tag>commentary</tag> from other parts of the text, with the exception of a cross-reference that originates <em>within</em> some <tag>commentary</tag>.</li>
            <li>Numbered items are prohibited within a <tag>commentary</tag>, such as a <tag>figure</tag> or a <tag>theorem</tag>.  Doing so would disrupt consecutive numbering in different versions, with or without, <tag>commentary</tag> included.  Numbered equations are not prohibited in the schema, but should definitely be avoided anyway.</li>
        </ul></p>

    <section>
        <title>Adding or Removing Divisions</title>

        <p>For an Instructor's Version you might wish to add additional material into the front matter (a specialized <tag>preface</tag> perhaps), or remove some material from the back matter (an <tag>appendix</tag> with solutions that duplicates solutions now placed within the exercises themselves).  There may also be parts of each chapter you do not find necessary to include.</p>

        <p>Modularizing your source files would allow for a different <q>master</q> <init>XML</init> source file to include different portions of the <tag>frontmatter</tag> or <tag>backmatter</tag>, perhaps just making a different title page.  See the Author's Guide for more on modularization.</p>

        <p>Additional, minimal, <init>XSLT</init> stylesheets can be used to selectively <q>kill</q> portions of your source, such as every <q>Additional Reading</q> at the end of each <tag>chapter</tag> residing in a <tag>references</tag>.  Consistent use of elements, leading strings in <attr>xml:id</attr>, and/or leading strings in <tag>title</tag>, can make it a single-line exercise to selectively remove multiple portions of your source without removing other portions.  see the Author's Guide for more about additional <init>XSLT</init> stylesheets.</p>

        <p>Think carefully about the effect of removals and additions on numbering.  In <init>HTML</init> output all numbering is hard-coded and will be based on counts of the entire <init>XML</init> source file.  So selectively killing content will not change numbering, but cross-references may point to divisions for which there is no content to serve as the target.  Using a different <q>master</q> file can impact numbering throughout.  Significant portions of the <latex /> output rely on <latex />'s automatic numbering via mechanisms like <c>\label{}</c> and <c>\ref{}</c>.  So if portions of the text are killed, then the <c>\label{}</c> of a cross-reference may never be defined.  A technical solution would be to provide an option to hard-code all numbering in <latex /> output.</p>

        <p>Generally, removing portions of each division will have the least ill-effects on numbering if the portions removed are at the end of a division and no cross-references point there.  So, for example, a <tag>references</tag> at the end of each <tag>chapter</tag> can be safely killed with no ill-effects if there are no cross-references elsewhere to the particular <tag>biblio</tag> contained in that <tag>references</tag>.</p>

        <p>When a division is killed through the use of additional <init>XSLT</init>, knowls and index entries will still be generated as usual for that division as part of the conversion to <init>HTML</init>.  Thus, some care may need to be taken if certain knowls should not be uploaded to a server.  Using a consistent scheme for the values of the <attr>xml:id</attr> might make this easy to script.  The <tag>idx</tag> elements could be killed in a manner similar to the division with a use of the <c>ancestor</c> axis in a filter.  Of course, the conversion to <latex /> will not create knowls, and the index-creation process does not suffer from the shortcomings of the creation process for <init>HTML</init>.</p>

        <title>Instructor's Notes</title>

        <p>The <tag>commentary</tag> element, as described above, can be used effectively by an individual instructor to customize a personal version of a book.  This is not as fine-grained as highlights or annotations, so is not meant as a replacement for tools that support more localized personal additions.</p>

        <p>The ideal way to do this would be with a text having source distributed as a git repository, and with notes managed by git.  Here is a rough outline, assuming a solid understanding of git.<ol>
            <li>Clone the author's repository to a local, personal, location.</li>
            <li>Make a long-lived <c>notes</c> branch off the author's <c>master</c> branch.</li>
            <li>Add <tag>commentary</tag> with commits on the <c>notes</c> branch.</li>
            <li>Regularly pull <c>master</c> from the original repository to receive updates and fixes from the author.</li>
            <li>Regularly merge <c>master</c> into <c>notes</c> so the enhanced version gets the author's changes without changing <c>master</c>.</li>
            <li>Produce personalized output from the <c>notes</c> branch via <pretext /> as normal, with the switch enabling display of the <tag>commentary</tag>.</li>
        </ol></p>
