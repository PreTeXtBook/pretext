<chapter xml:id="online-html">
    <title>(*) Conversion to Online HTML</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>Similar to the case for <latex /> conversion (<xref ref="pdf-print"/>) there is a variety of command-line processing parameters available (<xref ref="processing-parameters" />).  Until we are ready to document these carefully, open <c>xsl/mathbook-html.xsl</c> and poke around to see what is available.</p>
    </introduction>

    <section xml:id="knowled-content">
        <title>Knowled Content</title>

        <p>We knowl examples, proofs, and inline exercises by default, mostly so a new author knows that presentation is an option.  The knowlization of items can be controlled by a variety of command-line processing parameters (<xref ref="processing-parameters" />).  While these are in flux, we do not list them here, but instead suggest you open <c>xsl/mathbook-html.xsl</c> and search on <c>html.knowl</c> to see what is available.</p>

        <p>Note that some of these switches are for broad categories of items, for example, <c>html.knowl.theorem</c> will also knowl <tag>lemma</tag>s, <tag>corollary</tag>s, <tag>fact</tag>s, and more.  This choice applies document-wide, there is no plan to support electing this on a case-by-case basis.</p>
    </section>


    <section>
        <title>Lists</title>

        <p>On a description list (<tag>dl</tag>), only <attr>width</attr> values of <c>narrow</c> and <c>medium</c> are implemented. (2018-03-28)</p>

        <p>Lists with several columns are rendered in row-major order, as of 2018-02-28.  In other words, the first list items (<tag>li</tag>) in your source will populate the first row.</p>
