      A longer piece of text.
      It goes on and on and on.
      And on and on and on.
      And eventually we will let it end,
      but we want to show the width.

  <sidebyside>
    <p>
      Another little snippet of text.
      This time a bit longer so that it will wrap.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're going to keep this paragraph shorter.
