      A longer piece of text.
      It goes on and on and on.
      And on and on and on.
      And eventually we will let it end,
      but we want to show the width.

    <p>
      Another little snippet of text.
      This time a bit longer so that it will wrap.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're going to keep this paragraph shorter.

  <sidebyside widths="75% 10%">
    <p>Here is some text in a row where we have overridden the widths
    specified above. Isn't this grand?</p>
    <p>Super duper narrow. Look at me!</p>
