<chapter xml:id="conversions">
    <title>Conversions, Generally</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>A main goal of <pretext /> is to provide a language for describing a scholarly document by its structure, with contained content, and with no description of the presentation.  It then becomes possible to use software to produce different formats, where the presentation takes advantage of that format and enhances the meaning of the content through the expression of the structure.</p>

        <p>But different output formats have different capabilities.  For example, a conversion to <init>HTML</init> can take advantage of knowls to organize smaller chunks of content, while a conversion to <init>PDF</init> can take advantage of page numbers for cross-references.  And in these two examples, the capability of the one output format is mostly impossible or silly in the other.  Look here in this chapter for notes about options that are largely <em>independent</em> of the particular conversion.  Subsequent chapters contain notes about options that are largely <em>specific</em> to a particular conversion.</p>
    </introduction>

    <section xml:id="publisher-file">
        <title>Publisher File</title>

        <p>As of 2021-01-23 we are well along on a transition to providing options a publisher would choose via an <init>XML</init> <term>publisher file</term>.  Here we describe how to create and employ this file.  Details on actual options can be found throughout this guide, with terse reference material in <xref ref="publisher-file-reference"/>.  Note too, that <xref ref="processing-parameters"/> describes the old method (which is still in use, but will eventually be obsolete).</p>

        <p>Create a separate <init>XML</init> file the same way you always would.  Include the usual <init>XML</init> declaration as the first line.  Now, instead of the overall element being <tag>pretext</tag>, use <tag>publication</tag>.  That's it.  Various elements within <tag>publication</tag> will be used to specify options, typically attributes.  Name the file something that reminds you of its purpose, such as <c>pod.xml</c> for a print-on-demand version.</p>

        <p>To employ the file, you specify its filename on the <c>xsltproc</c> command line using a string parameter (<xref ref="processing-parameters"/>) named <c>publisher</c>.  This should have a path that is relative to the main file for the document.  For example, assuming <c>pod.xml</c> and <c>fauna.xml</c> are in the same directory<cd>
            <cline>xsltproc -stringparam publisher pod.xml pretext-html.xsl fauna.xml</cline>
        </cd>This file should reduce the many other string parameters in use, and reduce the need for extra <init>XSL</init> files (<xref ref="processing-thin-xsl"/>).</p>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="publisher-levels">
        <title>Levels Explained</title>
        <idx>levels</idx>

        <p>Every <pretext/> document has a hierarchy, even if it might not be very deep.  As an extreme example, for a sub-sub-section of a book, the <tag>subsubsection</tag> is contained in a <tag>subsection</tag>, that <tag>subsection</tag> is contained in a <tag>section</tag>, that <tag>section</tag> is contained in a <tag>chapter</tag>, and that <tag>chapter</tag> is contained in the <tag>book</tag>.  Each division of a document has a <term>level</term>, and the overall <term>root</term> element is always at level 0 (the <tag>book</tag> in the example).  Each other division is at some <tag>depth</tag>, computed by counting from the root.  So the <tag>subsubsection</tag> in the example is at level 4.</p>

        <p>Many aspects of the different outputs produced can be customized, typically via the publisher file (<xref ref="publisher-file"/>), based on how much of the hierarchy is used or made visible.  A good example is the Table of Contents.  If the level of the Table of Contents of a book is set to 2, then the Table of Contents will be <q>two-deep</q> or have <q>two levels</q> of entries.  More precisely, there will be titles (and maybe page numbers) for every <tag>chapter</tag> and every <tag>section</tag>.</p>

        <p>When hierarchical numbering is customized by specifying a level, the number of an object will have as many separators (periods, typically) as the level given.  Here's why.  Suppose equations are set to be numbered at level 2.  Then two levels of the hierarchy will be used to create the initial part of the number.  So in an <tag>article</tag>, Equation 5.2.34 will be in Subsection 2, of Chapter 5, and then will be the 34th equation of that sub-section.  Two levels: one separator to describe the division, one less that the number of levels (this is the <term>structure number</term>) and a second separator to set off the count within the division (the <term>serial number</term>).  So, <m>(2 - 1) + 1 = 2</m> separators.  See more on numbering at <xref ref="publisher-numbering"/>.</p>

        <p>Notice that you make no assumptions or decisions in your source about the depth of the Table of Contents, nor the numbering of equations.  At any time, right up to the completion of your project (or later!), you can change this aspect of your output with a nearly trivial edit in the publisher file.  Nice.</p>

    <section xml:id="publisher-numbering">
        <title>Numbering Explained</title>
        <idx>numbering</idx>

        <p><pretext/> targets the production of <q>structured scholary documents</q><mdash/>not novels, not magazine articles, not menus, and not travel brochures.  (Though a novel could work well?)  A research monograph might only be consulted for a portion of its content.  A good textbook should be useful to a reader after a course is over, and it should be easy to locate certain portions of the material.  A good textbook will foreshadow later material, and reinforce earlier material.  So we provide tools that lead to a quality index, reduce the overhead of making an accurate cross-reference, and make an automatic Table of Contents.  Page numbers can be a useful way to locate information for print output, but are less useful in an electronic <init>PDF</init> with hyperlinks, and are totally useless for online <init>HTML</init> and reflowable <init>EPUB</init>.  So we rely on copious hierarchical numbering to assist with locating discrete pieces of content.</p>

        <p>A <pretext/> document, like most any scholarly document has a hierarchy of <term>divisions</term>.  These are always numbered to reflect that hierachy.  So Subsection 4.7.2 of a <tag>book</tag> is the second sub-section of the seventh section of the fourth chapter of the book.  It is possible to specify that the numbering stops at some level, but that will limit how you can number smaller units of content.</p>

        <p><term>Blocks</term> are units of content held in a division.  An <tag>example</tag> is a good example.  These are always numbered, so that cross-references are as useful as possible in all output formats.  The number begins with a <term>structure number</term> that is the number of a division.  The division will contain the block, but does not need to be the closest containing division.  For example, Example 5.2.65 of a book has structure number 5.2, indicating it is in Section 2 of Chapter 5.  But this section might be structured as a sequence of sub-sections and Example 5.2.65 would be contained in one of these sub-sections.  But if we started counting all the examples in this <em>section</em> we would find Example 5.2.65 as the sixty-fifth numbered block of the whole <em>section</em>, even if it might only be the twenty-second example of its sub-section.  This final number is known as the <term>serial number</term>.  The granularity of the structure number may be configured.  This is a good place to suggest the complementary <xref ref="publisher-levels"/> on the meaning of the term <term>level</term>.</p>

        <p>Numbering of equations and footnotes may be configured in a manner entirely similar to that of blocks.</p>

        <p>As mentioned above, a number is a kind of <term>locator</term><mdash/>it should help a reader locate content, via a cross-reference, an index entry (a specialized cross-reference), or a Table of Contents.  It should also help a reader (teacher) tell another reader (student) where to find content, perhaps as part of a citation to a smaller item within a larger work.  How would you locate Example 5.2.65?  A Table of Contents, in any output format should get you to Section 5.2 quite easily.  We claim that the <tag>remark</tag> immediately preceeding Example 5.2.65 should be Remark 5.2.64.  In other words, it will easier to scan the section and quickly home in on the example if the serial numbers count <em>all</em> the numbered blocks, rather than having one sequence of serial numbers counting examples, and a second sequence counting remarks.  Not convinced?  Suppose there were two such sequences of serial numbers.  When you see Remark 5.2.23, should you move forward or backward in your search for Example 5.2.65?</p>

        <p>If it is so important to not have separate sequences of serial numbers, then why do equations and footnotes get their own sequences?  These items are substantially different visually, and even their numbers are formatted quite differently, so scanning for blocks or equations or footnotes should be very distinct visually.  Notice that it is their <em>distinctive appearance</em> that is the criteria for an independent sequence of serial numbers.</p>

        <p>We have implemented some flexibility for figures and tables, and for projects.  This work is in flux, so we have not yet documented the possibilities.  Our view is that figures and tables can be considered visually different enough to merit a separate sequence of serial numbers.</p>

    <section xml:id="customizations">
    <title>Customizations</title>
    <idx>customizations</idx>

        <p>The customization feature allows you to create two or more versions of your text for slightly different audiences. To do this, the author uses a custom element in the publisher file that points to a customization file. Multiple different customization files can be used to build different versions of the text. For example, we might want to create two versions of our biology book <init>AOTA</init>, one for zoologists and one for laypeople. For the zoologist edition we want animal names to be scientific names, but in the edition for laypeople we want to use common names. The rest of the text is identical. To execute this, we make every animal name a custom element and create a customization file for each of the two versions.</p>

        <p>Say we want to write a sentence that reads <q>The IUCN red list classification of the western lowland gorilla is critically endangered</q> in the layperson’s edition and <q>The IUCN red list classification of the <taxon>Gorilla gorilla gorilla</taxon> is critically endangered</q> in the zoologist’s edition. We begin by writing the sentence in the source and creating a custom element for the name of the gorilla:</p>

        <p><cd>The i&lt;nit>IUCN&lt;/init&gt; red list classification of the &lt;custom ref=“gorilla-name”/&gt; is critically endangered.</cd></p>

        <p>When naming the ref element, develop a consistent schema that makes sense to the authors. Don’t use spaces or capital letters. This ref element name will never be visible to readers but should be easy for developers to understand.</p>

        <p>Next, we create the customization file that this reference in the publisher file will point to. This file should be built in your source in a folder called <q>customizations.</q> Within this folder, create one file for each version of the text that may be built. The customization file opens with a special element and then contains a definition for each custom ref. We encourage commenting and systematic organization to keep your customizations straight.</p>

        <p>For the example above, here’s the beginning of the customization file we might name <q>zoologist.ptx.</q></p>

        <p><cd>
        &lt;pi:customizations xmlns:pi="http://pretextbook.org/2020/pretext/internal"&gt;
        &lt;!-- Name of Western mountain gorilla --&gt;
        &lt;custom name= “gorilla-name”>&lt;taxon&gt;Gorilla gorilla gorilla&lt;/taxon&gt;&lt;/custom&gt;
        &lt;/pi:customizations&gt;
        </cd></p>

        <p>Note that the <cd>&lt;custom name=&gt;</cd> element matches the custom ref from the text. Avoid any extra spaces. Then, we would also create a customization file named <q>layperson.ptx</q> and set it up in the same way. For this version, the same custom name element will contain the text <q>western lowland gorilla.</q> Once this is set up, the element <cd>&lt;custom ref=“gorilla-name”/&gt;</cd> can be used throughout the text and will populate automatically depending on which version is built. </p>

        <p><note> <title>Capitals and plurals</title> This functionality is limited when it comes to irregular plurals and capitalization. Take care with the placement of custom elements: they will not, for example, capitalize automatically at the beginning of a sentence.</note></p>

    <section xml:id="processing-parameters">
        <title>Processing Parameters</title>

        <p>Many of the options for different conversions are accomplished by command-line options, which are fed to <c>xsltproc</c> by what that program calls <term>string parameters</term>.  Here is an example:<cd>
            <cline>xsltproc -stringparam latex.font.size 14pt pretext-latex.xsl fauna.xml</cline>
        </cd>This will use a larger overall font size, while trying to preserve the same number of characters per line (with consequent smaller margins).</p>

        <p>Notice that this example does nothing to change the <em>words</em> that a conversion produces, which is why you do not specify them in your source, and why they are documented here in the <pubtitle>Publisher's Guide</pubtitle>.  They are conversion options that do not affect your content in significant ways, and are related to the particular output format.  Note that we are phasing out these parameters in favor of the Publisher's File (see <xref ref="publisher-file"/>).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Watermarks</title>

        <p>Output can contain a <term>watermark</term><idx>watermark</idx>, which is prominent text in the background of a document.  You might use it to make a draft version (with a date?), or a CONFIDENTIAL version, or a document intended for limited distribution, such as an instructor's solution manual.</p>

        <p>To use, specify the text, and an optional scaling factor to adjust the size.  If your text has spaces, you may need to enclose the string in quote marks so that it passes correctly into <c>xsltproc</c>.  For example, all on one line,<cd>
            <cline>xsltproc -stringparam watermark.text "DRAFT 2034-05-25"</cline>
            <cline>  -stringparam watermark.scale 0.5 pretext-latex.xsl fauna.xml</cline>
            <cline>         </cline>
        </cd></p>
