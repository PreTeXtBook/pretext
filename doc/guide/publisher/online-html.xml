<chapter xml:id="online-html">
    <title>Conversion to Online HTML</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>This chapter describes way a publisher can adjust the presentation of <pretext/> content in an inline format, without actually changing that content.  Similar to the case for <latex/> conversion (<xref ref="pdf-print"/>) there is a variety of options which may be configured.  As of 2020-05-30 we are transitioning away from command-line string parameters (<xref ref="processing-parameters"/>) to using a publisher file (<xref ref="publisher-file"/>), which is simultaneously being documented carefully.  During the transition you can explore <c>xsl/pretext-html.xsl</c> by searching on the use of <tag>xsl:param</tag> at the outermost level (i.e. starting in column 1).</p>
    </introduction>

    <section xml:id="html-publisher-options">
        <title>HTML Publisher Options</title>

        <subsection xml:id="index-page">
            <title><c>index.html</c> Page</title>
            <idx><h>index page</h><h>HTML</h></idx>
            <idx><h>HTML</h><h>index page</h></idx>

            <p>The conversion to <init>HTML</init> <em>always</em> creates a file named <c>index.html</c>.  We do this because if a reader requests the <init>URL</init><cd>
                <cline>platypus.mammal-institute.org/aota/html</cline>
            </cd>then most modern web servers will automatically return the page<cd>
                <cline>platypus.mammal-institute.org/aota/html/index.html</cline>
            </cd>So you can advertise the shorter version to potential readers.  What is in <c>index.html</c>?  Simple code to <term>redirect</term> to another one of your pages.  Which one?  Any one you like!</p>

            <p>Within the <tag>publication</tag> element of your publisher file (<xref ref="publisher-file"/>) include an <tag>html</tag> element, with a child element <tag>index-page</tag> having an attribute <attr>ref</attr>.  The value must be the <attr>xml:id</attr> of a division which is rendered as an entire web page at the requested level of chunking.  See <xref ref="online-index-page"/>  for details on specifying this option.</p>

            <p>For example, if a <tag>book</tag> is being chunked into <tag>chapter</tag>, and your source has<cd>
                <cline>&lt;chapter xml:id="birds"&gt;</cline>
            </cd>then you can set <c>ref="birds"</c> and the page for that chapter will be the default page for the shorter <init>URL</init>.  In practice, you probably really want a page that looks like the front matter or a Table of Contents.</p>

            <p>The default is to first have <c>index.html</c> redirect to a page for the <tag>frontmatter</tag>, and if this is not possible, then it will redirect to a page for the top-level of your content.  If your document is short or simple, you may just have a single web page.  You could choose to not distribute the <c>index.html</c> file and then just use a concise and descriptive <attr>xml:id</attr> for your top-level element (e.g. <tag>article</tag>) to fashion an attractive URL that points to your shorter work.</p>

            <title>Embedded Calculator</title>
            <idx><h>calculator</h><h>embedded in <init>HTML</init></h></idx>

            <p>You may elect to have an embedded online calculator in each page of your online version.  It will appear in the right margin, and will stay there as a reader scrolls the page up and down.  A button near the masthead can be used to contol visibility.  By default no calculator is available, so you need to explicitly request this feature.  As of 2020-05-30 there are four calculators available from the GeoGebra Project<fn><url href="https://www.geogebra.org/">www.geogebra.org</url></fn>.  See <xref ref="online-calculator"/> for details on specifying this option.</p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="online-base-url">
            <title>Base URL</title>
            <idx><h>calculator</h><h>embedded in <init>HTML</init></h></idx>

            <p>The base <init>URL</init> of a hosted version of <init>HTML</init> output may be specified as an entry in a publisher file.  Then certain aspects of other output (typically <init>PDF</init>/<latex/>) will link to corresponding aspects of the <init>HTML</init> output.  See <xref ref="online-baseurl"/> for the specifics of this entry.  Examples of use include links from Asymptote graphics (<xref ref="latex-asymptote-links"/>).</p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection xml:id="video-embedding">
            <title>Privacy Options for Video Embedding</title>
            <idx><h>video</h><h>HTML</h></idx>
            <idx><h>privacy</h><h>video</h></idx>

            <p>When videos are embedded in <init>HTML</init> from sites like <url href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</url> or <url href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</url>,
            they come with whatever tracking cookies these sites want to include. Some of these can be helpful; for example, to let the viewer keep track of what they have watched.
            Others are designed to target advertising, and load when the page loads, rather than when the video plays, which can increase the time it takes for your book to load.</p>

            <p>Currently YouTube offers an <q>enhanced privacy mode</q> that disables tracking cookies on page load.
            The assumption is that publishers will want to protect their readers' privacy and optimage page load time, so this mode is turned on by default for YouTube videos.
            It is not known to be available for other platforms, but can be added if this changes. Note that the behavior and appearance of your videos may change slightly depending on which option you choose.</p>

            <p>Within the <tag>publication</tag> element of your publisher file include an <tag>html</tag> element, with a child element <tag>video</tag> having an attribute <attr>privacy</attr>.
            The value must be either <c>yes</c> (use enhanced privacy, if available), or <c>no</c> (allow all tracking cookies).
            If your publisher file does not have this element (or you do not have a publisher file) you will get a warning message, and the default will be used.  See <xref ref="embedded-video-privacy-options"/> for details on specifying this option.</p>

    <section xml:id="knowled-content">
        <title>Knowled Content</title>

        <p>A <term>knowl</term> is a feature of the online conversion. It is text that you can click on, and nearby some content is revealed. You can click it again to hide that content.  You can find a variety of examples in the Sample Article, or other <pretext/> projects.</p>

        <p>Knowls come in two different types:<ul>
            <li>A <term>born-hidden knowl</term> or <term>born-as knowl</term> is content that is contained in a knowl at the location where it first appears.  Typical examples are footnotes, hints to exercises, or proofs of theorems.  In other words, these small units of content are <q>hidden</q> behind knowls in the location where they naturally belong.  Some content (e.g. footnotes and exercise solutions) are <em>always</em> <term>knowled</term>, while other content (e.g. an inline exercise) can be knowled, or not, as a choice made by the publisher via the Publisher's File (<xref ref="publisher-file"/>).  For exact details on influencing knowlization see the reference material in <xref ref="online-knowlization-options"/>.</li>

            <li>By contrast, a <term>cross-reference knowl</term> or an <term>xref knowl</term> is content that is a duplicate of some other content, in another location, as a result of an author making an <tag>xref</tag> cross-reference in their source.  So a cross-reference in Chapter<nbsp/>8 to Example<nbsp/>4.6 will open the content of the example in the knowl, rather than transporting the reader backwards four chapters.  If the reader <em>does</em> want to see the example in its original context in Chapter 4, then the knowl finishes with an <term>in-context</term> link that functions as a traditional hyperlink.  Almost every cross-reference is a knowl, except when the target is a division<mdash/>then a traditional hyperlink is used, since rendering an entire division as a knowl is unwieldy.</li>
        </ul>The presence of the in-context link is one way to tell the difference between the two.  Locators in the index (<xref ref="online-index-style"/>) are mostly cross-reference knowls.  Knowls are used a few other places, such as in a list of notation.</p>

        <p>An author does not need to be conscious of knowls. The structure and content of the document should not <q>be aware</q> that there will be knowls in the online output.  But instead the publisher has control over whether or not certain medium-sized pieces of content (examples, exercises, figures, etc.) are born as knowls or not.</p>

        <p>Note that some of these switches are for broad categories of items, for example, choosing to knowl theorems will also knowl <tag>lemma</tag>s, <tag>corollary</tag>s, <tag>fact</tag>s, and more.  See <xref ref="online-knowlization-options"/> for precise details.  This choice applies document-wide, there is no plan to support electing this on a case-by-case basis.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Permalinks</title>

        <p>If you place a mouse pointer in the left margin, to the left of a heading for an item, then an icon with two links of a chain will appear.  This is a link to the item.  Instead of a doing a right-click for a context menu that has an option like <q>Copy Link Location</q>, rather do a normal (left-) click.  This will copy the heading (<q>Example 4.5 Chameleon Colors</q>), and also the link itself, to your clipboard, along with some formatting.  You can then paste this into course materials, or email it to a reader who had a question.</p>

        <p>You might want to make this feature known to your readers, perhaps via a preface explaining some of the more novel features of the <init>HTML</init> version of a <pretext/> document.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Lists</title>

        <p>On a description list (<tag>dl</tag>), only <attr>width</attr> values of <c>narrow</c> and <c>medium</c> are implemented. (2018-03-28)</p>

        <p>Lists with several columns are rendered in row-major order, as of 2018-02-28.  In other words, the first list items (<tag>li</tag>) in your source will populate the first row.</p>

    </section>

    <section xml:id="online-index-style">
        <title>Index Style</title>

        <p>The <pubtitle>Author's Guide</pubtitle> explains how to create an index.  The realization of the index for online output is implemented within <pretext/>.  We have made certain stylistic choices, in addition to taking advantage of certain features of the online format.<ul>
            <li>A one-column format.</li>
            <li>Indented subheadings (not run-in).</li>
            <li>Maximum two levels of subheadings.</li>
            <li>Word-by-word sort order on headings.</li>
            <li>Locators for divisions are hyperlinks.</li>
            <li>Locators for smaller units are knowls.</li>
            <li><q>Page ranges</q> use the initial location.</li>
            <li>No running heads (yet).</li>
            <li>A <term>headnote</term> can be accomplished with an <tag>introduction</tag>.</li>
        </ul>Some of these choices would be easy to adjust or extend as the result of a feature request.</p>

        <p>Also, there can be significant differences between how <pretext/> implements the index for <init>HTML</init> and how the <c>imakeidx</c> package creates an index for <latex/>.  See <xref ref="latex-index-style"/> and <xref ref="indexing-guide"/>.</p>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="online-style">
        <title>Styling</title>
        <idx><h>style</h><h>HTML</h></idx>


        <introduction>
            <p>The <pretext/> conversion to <init>HTML</init> creates standard <init>HTML</init> elements, with styles controlled by <init>CSS</init> via class names (and not so much via the element names).  As evidence of this, building <init>HTML</init> without the accompanying Javascript and <init>CSS</init> renders in a readable fashion, albeit quite plain (as one would expect).  This section describes ways that a publisher can influence the style.</p>
        </introduction>

        <subsection>
            <title>Colors</title>

            <p>The publisher file may be used to specify alternate CSS files.  See the reference material for how to do this (<xref ref="online-style-options"/>).  The default file, <c>colors_default.css</c> contains documentation on how to design a theme.</p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection>
            <title>Table of Contents, Knowls, and Banner</title>

            <p>In a manner analagous to how colors may be adjusted, so may other parts of the HTML UI, see <xref ref="online-style-options"/>).  As of 2019-12-08, replacing more than one of these at a time should be considered experimental.</p>
        </subsection>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="online-analytics">
        <title>Analytics</title>
        <idx>analytics</idx>

        <p><pretext/> makes it as easy as possible to have services provide data about visitors to the <init>HTML</init> version of your book.  We support <url hef="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">Google Analytics</url><fn><c>analytics.google.com/analytics/web/</c></fn> and <url hef="https://statcounter.com/">StatCounter</url><fn><c>statcounter.com/</c></fn>.</p>

        <p>In each case, use is similar.  Begin at the service's site and follow their instructions for enabling data collection for your book's site.  We will not document those instructions here.  <em>Do not copy the identification numbers from another project<mdash/>be sure to obtain your own for your project.</em>  When completed, you can request (or will be shown) sample Javascript code to add to pages on your site.  Except, <pretext/> is going to do that part for you.  You only need to provide the unique identifiers used by the service that identify your project.  Because these sign-ups are dependent on your site, this is a publisher activity, and hence configured with the publisher file (<xref ref="publisher-file"/>), see <xref ref="online-analytics-options"/> for details.</p>

        <p>StatCounter uses two identifiers, a <c>project</c> ID and a <c>security</c> code.  <em>Do not copy the identification numbers from another project<mdash/>be sure to obtain your own for your project.</em>  You can find them in your <q>Project Config</q> under <q>Settings</q>.  Or the code provided will contain lines such as<cd>
            <cline>var sc_project=11538430;</cline>
            <cline>var sc_invisible=1;</cline>
            <cline>var sc_security="72e1390a";</cline>
        </cd>In which case your publisher file would have an element under <c>html</c> like<cd>
            <cline>&lt;analytics statcounter-project="11538430"</cline>
            <cline>           statcounter-security"72e1390a"/&gt;</cline>
        </cd></p>

        <p>Google Analytics comes in several flavors.  We once supported Classic and Universal, but no longer, so we do not provide documentation here.  For the replacement, Google <term>Global Site Tag</term> is a single ID.    <em>Do not copy the identification numbers from another project<mdash/>be sure to obtain your own for your project.</em>  Google once called this a tracking ID, which may also be called a property ID.  An example looks like <c>UA-6836004-1</c>.  Google is also using a <term>Meaurement ID</term> which might look similar to <c>G-CQG9X37H61</c>.  In either case your publisher file would have an element under <c>html</c> like<cd>
            <cline>&lt;analytics google-gst="UA-6836004-1"/&gt;</cline>
        </cd> or <cd>
            <cline>&lt;analytics google-gst="G-CQG9X37H61"/&gt;</cline>
        </cd>If you use both services, you can elect to use just one <tag>analytics</tag> element with several attributes.</p>

        <p>We would be happy to provide support for additional major services.  Just make a feature request.</p>

    <section xml:id="one-page-html">
        <title>Single Page HTML</title>

        <p>Sometimes you would like a shorter work to be a <em>single</em> file in <init>HTML</init> format.  Perhaps it is something self-contained, like a course syllabus, or you desire to attach it easily to an email or other post.  This section contains advice and procedures you can use to achieve this.<ul>
            <li>Design your source as an <tag>article</tag>, with or without <tag>section</tag>.</li>
            <li>Set the chunking option to zero (see <xref ref="common-chunking-options"/>).  This will prevent making a separate page for each <tag>section</tag> (or worse).</li>
            <li>If you set the level for the Table of Contents to zero, there will be no sidebar Table of Contents at all.  This does not affect the number of files, but will make the page simpler.  Your call.  See <xref ref="common-toc-options"/>.</li>
            <li>You might want to number some objects consecutively for the whole page, even if you choose to have <tag>section</tag>.  And if you do this, you might want to not even number the <tag>section</tag>.  None of this affect the number of files, but may make a single page look simpler.  See <xref ref="publisher-file-numbering"/> to see how to accomplish these options.</li>
            <li>Items that are <q>born hidden</q> as knowls, either automatically (<tag>answer</tag>, <tag>fn</tag>, <ellipsis/>) or electively (<tag>example</tag>, <tag>warning</tag>, <ellipsis/>) are contained in the page, so also do not affect the number of files.</li>
            <li>Cross-references (<tag>xref</tag>) rely on external files for the content they reveal.  Default behavior is to <em>not</em> create knowls when the target is a larger piece of content, such as divisions (<tag>section</tag>, <tag>subsection</tag>), and instead build a traditional hyperlink.  Cross-references to smaller items, bibliography entries, and when employed in the index, will create knowls and the necessary external files.  (2020-08-09: we could implement a publisher switch to make all cross-references realized as hyperlinks.  Make a request on one of the groups.)  So until we have a blanket-hyperlink option, do not cross-reference smaller units of content.</li>
            <li>You will likely get a subdirectory called <c>knowls</c>.  As of 2020-08-09 it has many files that are not necessary and we are working to reduce the number to just the essentials.  If you are sure you have no cross-references to smaller units of content, then you can delete this directory.</li>
            <li>An <init>HTML</init> build always makes a <c>index.html</c> file which will cause a webserver to redirect to a page of the publisher's choosing.  You can safely delete it.</li>
        </ul></p>
