<chapter xml:id="online-html">
    <title>Conversion to Online HTML</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>Similar to the case for <latex /> conversion (<xref ref="pdf-print"/>) there is a variety of command-line processing parameters available (<xref ref="processing-parameters" />).  Until we are ready to document these carefully, open <c>xsl/mathbook-html.xsl</c> and poke around to see what is available.</p>
    </introduction>

    <section xml:id="html-publisher-options">
        <title>HTML Publisher Options</title>

        <paragraphs>
            <title><c>index.html</c> Page</title>

            <p>The conversion to <init>HTML</init> <em>always</em> creates a file named <c>index.html</c>.  We do this because if a reader requests the <init>URL</init><cd>
                <cline>platypus.mammal-institute.org/aota/html</cline>
            </cd>then most modern web servers will automatically return the page<cd>
                <cline>platypus.mammal-institute.org/aota/html/index.html</cline>
            </cd>So you can advertise the shorter version to potential readers.  What is in <c>index.html</c>?  Simple code to <term>redirect</term> to another one of your pages.  Which one?  Any one you like!</p>

            <p>Within the <tag>publication</tag> element of your publisher file (<xref ref="publisher-file"/>) include an <tag>html</tag> element, with a child element <tag>index-page</tag> having an attribute <attr>ref</attr>.  The value must be the <attr>xml:id</attr> of a division which is rendered as an entire web page at the requested level of chunking.</p>

            <p>For example, if a <tag>book</tag> is being chunked into <tag>chapter</tag>, and your source has<cd>
                <cline>&lt;chapter xml:id="birds"&gt;</cline>
            </cd>then you can set <c>ref="birds"</c> and the page for that chapter will be the default page for the shorter <init>URL</init>.  In practice, you probably really want a page that looks like the front matter or a Table of Contents.</p>

            <p>The default is to first have <c>index.html</c> redirect to a page for the <tag>frontmatter</tag>, and if this is not possible, then it will redirect to a page for the top-level of your content.  If your document is short or simple, you may just have a single web page.  You do not need to distribute the <c>index.html</c> file and may just wish to use a concise and descriptive <attr>xml:id</attr> for your top-level element.</p>
        </paragraphs>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="knowled-content">
        <title>Knowled Content</title>

        <p>A <term>knowl</term> is a feature of the online conversion. It is text that you can click on, and nearby some content is revealed. You can click it again to hide that content.  You can find a variety of examples in the Sample Article, or other <pretext/> projects.</p>

        <p>Knowls come in two different types:<ul>
            <li>A <term>born-hidden knowl</term> or <term>born-as knowl</term> is content that is contained in a knowl at the location where it first appears.  Typical examples are footnotes, hints to exercises, or proofs of theorems.  In other words, these small units of content are <q>hidden</q> behind knowls in the location where they naturally belong.  Some content (e.g. footnotes) are always <term>knowled</term>, while other content (e.g. an inline exercise) can be knowled, or not, as a choice made by the publisher.</li>

            <li>By contrast, a <term>cross-reference knowl</term> or an <term>xref knowl</term> is content that is a duplicate of some other content, in another location, as a result of an author making an <tag>xref</tag> cross-reference in their source.  So a cross-reference in Chapter<nbsp/>8 to Example<nbsp/>4.6 will open the content of the example in the knowl, rather than transporting the reader backwards four chapters.  If the reader <em>does</em> want to see the example in its original context in Chapter 4, then the knowl finishes with an <term>in-context</term> link that functions as a traditional hyperlink.  Almost every cross-reference is a knowl, except when the target is a division<mdash/>then a traditional hyperlink is used, since rendering an entire division as a knowl is unwieldy.</li>
        </ul>The presence of the in-context link is one way to tell the difference between the two.  Locators in the index (<xref ref="online-index-style"/>) are mostly cross-reference knowls.  Knowls are used a few other places, such as in a list of notation.</p>

        <p>An author does not need to be conscious of knowls. The structure and content of the document should not <q>be aware</q> that there will be knowls in the online output.  But the publisher has some control over whether or not certain medium-sized pieces of content (examples, exercises, figures, etc.) are born as knowls or not.   While these processing parameters (<xref ref="processing-parameters" />) are in flux, we do not list them here, but instead suggest you open <c>xsl/mathbook-html.xsl</c> and search on <c>html.knowl</c> to see what is available.</p>

        <p>Note that some of these switches are for broad categories of items, for example, <c>html.knowl.theorem</c> will also knowl <tag>lemma</tag>s, <tag>corollary</tag>s, <tag>fact</tag>s, and more.  This choice applies document-wide, there is no plan to support electing this on a case-by-case basis.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Lists</title>

        <p>On a description list (<tag>dl</tag>), only <attr>width</attr> values of <c>narrow</c> and <c>medium</c> are implemented. (2018-03-28)</p>

        <p>Lists with several columns are rendered in row-major order, as of 2018-02-28.  In other words, the first list items (<tag>li</tag>) in your source will populate the first row.</p>

    </section>

    <section xml:id="online-index-style">
        <title>Index Style</title>

        <p>The <pubtitle>Author's Guide</pubtitle> explains how to create an index.  The realization of the index for online output is implemented within <pretext/>.  We have made certain stylistic choices, in addition to taking advantage of certain features of the online format.<ul>
            <li>A one-column format.</li>
            <li>Indented subheadings (not run-in).</li>
            <li>Maximum two levels of subheadings.</li>
            <li>Word-by-word sort order on headings.</li>
            <li>Locators for divisions are hyperlinks.</li>
            <li>Locators for smaller units are knowls.</li>
            <li><q>Page ranges</q> use the initial location.</li>
            <li>No running heads (yet).</li>
            <li>A <term>headnote</term> can be accomplished with an <tag>introduction</tag>.</li>
        </ul>Some of these choices would be easy to adjust or extend as the result of a feature request.</p>

        <p>Also, there can be significant differences between how <pretext/> implements the index for <init>HTML</init> and how the <c>imakeidx</c> package creates an index for <latex/>.  See <xref ref="latex-index-style"/> and <xref ref="indexing-guide"/>.</p>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="online-style">
        <title>Styling</title>
        <idx><h>style</h><h>HTML</h></idx>


        <introduction>
            <p>The PreTeXt conversion to <init>HTML</init> creates standard <init>HTML</init> elements, with styles controlled by <init>CSS</init> via class names (and not so much via the element names).  As evidence of this, building <init>HTML</init> without the accompanying Javascript and <init>CSS</init> renders in a readable fashion, albeit quite plain (as one would expect).  This section describes ways that a publisher can influence the style.</p>
        </introduction>

        <subsection>
            <title>Colors</title>

            <p>The publisher file may be used to specify alternate CSS files.  See the reference material for how to do this (<xref ref="online-style-options"/>).  The default file, <c>colors_default.css</c> contains documentation on how to design a theme.</p>
        </subsection>

        <subsection>
            <title>Table of Contents, Knowls, and Banner</title>

            <p>In a manner analagous to how colors may be adjusted, so may other parts of the HTML UI, see<xref ref="online-style-options"/>).  As of 2019-12-08, replacing more than one of these at a time should be considered experimental.</p>
        </subsection>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="online-analytics">
        <title>Analytics</title>
        <idx>analytics</idx>

        <p><pretext/> makes it as easy as possible to have services provide data about visitors to the <init>HTML</init> version of your book.  We support <url hef="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">Google Analytics</url><fn><c>analytics.google.com/analytics/web/</c></fn> and <url hef="https://statcounter.com/">StatCounter</url><fn><c>statcounter.com/</c></fn>.</p>

        <p>In each case, use is similar.  Begin at the service's site and follow their instructions for enabling data collection for your book's site.  We will not document those instructions here.  When completed, you can request (or will be shown) sample Javascript code to add to pages on your site.  Except, <pretext/> is going to do that part for you.  You only need to provide the unique identifiers used by the service that identify your project.  Because these sign-ups are dependent on your site, this is a publisher activity, and hence configured with the publisher file (<xref ref="publisher-file"/>), see <xref ref="online-analytics-options"/> for details.</p>

        <p>StatCounter uses two identifiers, a <c>project</c> ID and a <c>security</c> code.  You can find them in your <q>Project Config</q> under <q>Settings</q>.  Or the code provided will contain lines such as<cd>
            <cline>var sc_project=11538430;</cline>
            <cline>var sc_invisible=1;</cline>
            <cline>var sc_security="72e1390a";</cline>
        </cd>In which case your publisher file would have an element under <c>html</c> like<cd>
            <cline>&lt;analytics statcounter-project="11538430"</cline>
            <cline>           statcounter-security"72e1390a"/&gt;</cline>
        </cd></p>

        <p>Google Analytics comes in several flavors.  We once supported Classic and Universal, but no longer, so we do not provide documentation here.  For the replacement, Google <term>Global Site Tag</term> is a single ID.  Google once called this a tracking ID, which may also be called a property ID.  An example looks like <c>UA-6836004-1</c>.  In which case your publisher file would have an element under <c>html</c> like<cd>
            <cline>&lt;analytics google-gst="UA-6836004-1"/&gt;</cline>
        </cd>If you use both services, you can elect to use just one <tag>analytics</tag> element with several attributes.</p>

        <p>We would be happy to provide support for additional major services.  Just make a feature request.</p>
