    <title>Conversion to EPUB/Kindle</title>
    <introduction>
    <p><init>EPUB</init> is the standard format for electronic books. Books in EPUB format can be read using applications on a variety of platforms. (Apple Books across the entire Apple ecosystem. <url href="http://calibre-ebook.com" visible="calibre-ebook.com">Calibre</url> is open source and cross-platform for desktop usage. Android devices have options as well.) Amazon's Kindle devices use a proprietary format that is derived from <init>EPUB</init>. Through much experimentation, the <pretext /> team has determined that <init>SVG</init> mathematics, generated by MathJax offline tools, works well in all ebook readers <em>other</em> than Kindle apps and devices. For Kindle, MathML is the best format. (Apple's MathML implementation is very poor as of July 2021, and so we cannot recommend math formatted using MathML for situations where readers may use the Apple Books app.) Thus, we provide <em>two</em> pathways for production of electronic books. These formats are useful as an offline version, which is superior to a <init>PDF</init> in some ways, such as font face and font size being controlled by the software in an e-reader device.  However, it is inferior to the online version (<xref ref="online-html"/>), since many interactive features cannot function within the <init>EPUB</init> version.</p>
    </introduction>

    <section>
	<title>Prerequisites</title>
    <p>There are a handful of prerequisites to build an <init>EPUB</init> version of a book:
    <ul>
	<li>A publisher file (referred to below as <c>publication.xml</c>) with <cd>source/directories/@generated</cd> and <cd>source/directories/@external</cd> must be used so that images can be located and bundled. The publisher file must also have <c>epub/@cover</c> that points to a cover image (<init>JPEG</init> or <init>PNG</init>, 2560 pixels tall, 1600 pixels wide).</li> <li>If the book has images generated by the <c>pretext/pretext</c> script, <init>SVG</init> format must be produced for standard EPUB and <init>PNG</init> format must be produced for Kindle.</li> <li><c>node</c> and <c>npm</c> must be installed</li>.
    </ul>
    Furthermore, builds using <c>xsltproc</c> are not supported, since creating an EPUB file is a multi-stage process that has been automated for you using the <c>pretext/pretext</c> script.
    </p>

    <p>As occasional support commands you may need to run, you should be aware of the script <c>css/update_css</c>, which is a Python script that gets the latest <init>CSS</init>. The copy of the <init>CSS</init> that comes from the <pretext /> repository is occasionally updated, but if you have been advised (perhaps on the <c>pretext-support</c> Google group) that CSS has been updated, you should run this script. You generally won't have to run it to get started. You also will need to run, at least once, the script <c>script/mjsre/update-sre</c>, which ensures that you have the latest offline version of MathJax. You only need to run this script in the future if someone advises you to update the version of MathJax you have. See <xref ref="node-and-npm" /> for more on <c>node</c> and <c>npm</c>.</p>

	<title>Converting and validating</title>
    <p>Converting to <init>EPUB</init> with <init>SVG</init> math (used everywhere other than Kindle), run as a single command-line
    <cd>
        <cline>/path/to/mathbook/pretext/pretext -c all -f epub-svg</cline>
        <cline>    -p publication.xml -d /path/to/output</cline>
        <cline>    -o mybook-svg.epub /path/to/yourmainfile.ptx</cline>
    </cd>
    For an <init>EPUB</init> file destined for Kindle, use the single command-line
    <cd>
        <cline>/path/to/mathbook/pretext/pretext -c all -f epub-kindle</cline>
        <cline>    -p publication.xml -d /path/to/output</cline>
        <cline>    -o mybook-kindle.epub /path/to/yourmainfile.ptx</cline>
    </cd></p>

    <p>For the <c>epub-svg</c> conversion, any standard <init>EPUB</init> reader should work. macOS users will find the Apple Book app is likely their default. Calibre is useful for an alternative view and works on Windows and Linux as well. For the <c>epub-kindle</c> conversion, you will need to get <url href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000765261" visual="www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000765261">Amazon's Kindle Previewer app</url> (macOS and Windows only). For reasons we do not understand, some books crash the Kindle Previewer app, in which case you should try loading the <init>EPUB</init> file into the Amazon KDP web interface, which also offers a preview. (This preview is the only option for Linux users.)</p>

    <p>Many <init>EPUB</init> marketplaces are strict about requiring that your <init>EPUB</init> file pass validation by the open source <c>epubcheck</c> validation tool. You may be able to install a command-line version of <c>epubcheck</c> using your operating system's package management tool. A free Java-based GUI version <url href="https://www.pagina.gmbh/produkte/epub-checker/" visual="www.pagina.gmbh/produkte/epub-checker/">released by Pagina</url> might be useful. There is also a (slow, limited) online version.  Please report validation errors and oddly-formatted electronic book output to the <c>pretext-support</c> Google group. Some aspects of <pretext /> have not yet been fully implemented for EPUB, but we will endeavor to support them as demand arises.</p>

	<title>Distribution</title>
	<p>Because the <init>EPUB</init> file built for Kindle is different than what we build for all other readers, you <em>must</em> distribute the Kindle version of your book through Amazon's KDP. Because Amazon and Kindle have the overwhelming majority of the electronic book market in the United States, if your readers are mainly in the United States, we highly recommend that you get your Kindle version in good shape.</p>
	<p>Distribution of the <init>EPUB</init> file produced by the <c>epub-svg</c> conversion can be done through electronic book aggregators. There are many options available, and they all take an additional commission on top of what the electronic book marketplace through which a reader buys your book takes, but using such a service can save you from needing to post your electronic book on a variety of marketplaces. <alert>Do not allow an aggregator to distribute your book to Amazon, as the math will not render properly.</alert> It is as simple as <em>not</em> checking the box for Amazon when signing up with an aggregator to opt out of having the aggregator send your book to Amazon.</p>
