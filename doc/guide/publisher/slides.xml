    <introduction>
        <p>
            As discussed in <xref ref="overview-slides"/> and <xref ref="topic-slides"/>,
            support is available for authoring slideshows in <pretext/>. Currently, slideshows
            must be authored explicitly, but we hope to eventually support annotating
            books and articles to export appropriate content as slides.

        <title>Reveal.js</title>
        <p>
            Run this to produce a Reveal.js slideshow:<cd>
                <cline>xsltproc --xinclude -o path/to/output/slides.html</cline>
                <cline>  path/to/pretext/xsl/pretext-revealjs.xsl path/to/source/slides.xml</cline>
            </cd>
        </p>

            Reveal.js supports themes that affect the overall appearance of a slideshow.
            So in <pretext/> you can specify the name of theme in a publisher file.
            See <xref ref="revealjs-appearance-options"/> for details.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may assume that your slideshow will be presented with the internet available,
            perhaps in a classroom, and will be updated for use the next semester.
            Or maybe you are presenting at a conference where you do not want to trust an unfamiliar internet connection,
            and you will later host an archival version of your presentation on your website and you want it to <q>just work</q> ten years from now.
            So you can configure your slideshow to obtain resources from a Content Delivery Network (<init>CDN</init>) online,
            or you may arrange to copy the necessary files from reveal.js and store them locally (your hard disk, your website).
            See <xref ref="revealjs-resources-options"/> for the necessary details.

    <section xml:id="publisher-beamer">
        <title>Beamer <latex/></title>
        <p>
            Run this to produce a Beamer <latex/> slideshow:<cd>
                <cline>xsltproc --xinclude -o path/to/output/slides.tex</cline>
                <cline>  path/to/pretext/xsl/pretext-beamer.xsl path/to/source/slides.xml</cline>
            </cd>
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, you should then run e.g. <c>pdflatex slides.tex</c> to produce a PDF.
