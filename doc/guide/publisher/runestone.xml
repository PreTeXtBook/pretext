    <title>Conversion to Runestone</title>

    <introduction>
        <p><url href="https://runestone.academy" visual="runestone.academy">Runestone Interactive</url> is a textbook hosting system orginally designed for <init>HTML</init> textbooks about computer science.  It is similar in design and goals to <pretext/>, but is also complementary in important ways.  In particular, Runestone excels at providing very interactive versions where student work in the textbook can be graded (automatically or manually), scores recorded, and that information can be viewed by an instructor.  Any instructor can easily spin-up an instance of your book for their course, at no charge to the school or to the students.</p>
    </introduction>

    <section>
        <title>About Runestone Academy</title>

        <p>Runestone textbooks are designed around interactive activities and active reading.  We are well along in the process of exposing these capabilities via <pretext/> markup, as of 2022-06-13.  Expect this list to expand, and change slightly, as we make further progress.<ul>
            <li>Every feature of the usual <pretext/> <init>HTML</init> output should function identically on a Runestone server.</li>
            <li>Any <tag>exercise</tag> authored in <pretext/> can be electively rendered as a Runestone short answer question, when the Runestone platform is targeted as the host.  A student can use <latex/> notation in formulating their answer, and Runestone will provide the instructor an efficient interface for reviewing student responses, provide feedback, and assign scores.  See <xref ref="online-short-answer-options"/> for options that will silence this behavior.</li>
            <li>We have designed markup for the various types of problems available in Runestone: True/False, multiple choice, Parsons problems, matching, clickable area, (basic) fill-in, and ActiveCode programming exercises.  Hosted on Runestone, readers have their responses graded and get instant feedback, plus their results are saved at the site.  For other <init>HTML</init> output, hosted on your own server, these problems are automatically graded and the reader gets instant feedback, but of course, responses and scores are not saved anywhere.</li>
            <li>As much as possible, non-interactive versions of these problems will render in less-capable formats, like <init>PDF</init>, <init>EPUB</init>, and braille.</li>
            <li>A <tag>program</tag> element with the attribute <attr>interactive</attr> set to <c>activecode</c> will be realized as a Runestone ActiveCode element, where programs can be edited, compiled, and run.  In some cases a CodeLens interactive trace utility is available.  The <attr>language</attr> must be set.  Supported values for the language when hosted at Runestone are: <c>python</c>, <c>python2</c>, <c>python3</c>, <c>c</c>, <c>cpp</c> (C++), <c>javascript</c>, <c>java</c>, <c>octave</c> (Matlab), <c>sql</c>, and <c>html</c>.  When hosted on your own server, <c>python</c>, <c>javascript</c>, <c>sql</c>, and <c>html</c>, are supported with in-browser routines.  So you do not need to configure <em>anything</em> server-side for this capability.</li>
            <li>Programs may be supplied with the CodeLens utility, allowing a reader to step through the program.  This ability vbaries by language, and by hosting location.</li>
            <li>More <pretext/> markup for Runestone books is coming and will go here.</li>
            <li>All of the interactive exercises on a Runestone server can be worked by a student at the location in the book where they were authored, or a student may use the interface provided by the server (the <term>assignment page</term>) to locate exercises assigned by an instructor, at a location disjoint from the text itself.</li>
            <li>Students and instructors are provided extensive reports on progress.</li>
            <li>Instructors may download a spreadsheet of scores at any time.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>We will not attempt to duplicate Runestone's documentation here.  Visit the <url href="https://runestone.academy" visual="runestone.academy">Runestone Academy</url> site to learn more about all the features designed for hosting your textbook for everybody's courses.</p>

        <title>Publishing to Runestone Academy</title>

            <p>The usual <pretext/> <init>HTML</init> output (<xref ref="online-html"/>) only needs minor modifications to run profitably on a Runestone server.  You accomplish this via a publication file (<xref ref="publication-file"/>).  The absolute simplest publication file to accomplish this is<cd>
                <cline>&lt;publication&gt;</cline>
                <cline>  &lt;html&gt;</cline>
                <cline>    &lt;platform host="runestone"/&gt;</cline>
                <cline>  &lt;/html&gt;</cline>
                <cline>&lt;/publication&gt;</cline>
            </cd>(See <xref ref="online-platform-options"/>.)  Then perform the usual conversion to online <init>HTML</init>, as described in <xref ref="online-html"/> but also be sure to specify the publication file.  The output should appear like a usual <pretext/> document, but will now include a new menu on each page.  This has options which allow a reader or instructor to interact with the Runestone server, once hosted there.</p>

        <p>
            While this HTML may be manually deployed to any Runestone server, authors who wish to publish their
            work on the <url href="https://runestone.academy" visual="Runestone.Academy">Runestone Academy</url>
            server have a few more requirements.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Your project must be managed using the CLI (<xref ref="processing-CLI"/>). If you didn't
                    create it using <c>pretext new</c>, run <c>pretext init</c> to get started upgrading.
                    You'll also need to make it available to the public via GitHub (instructions below).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You should create a new <c>&lt;target name="runestone"&gt;&lt;/target&gt;</c> in your <c>project.ptx</c>.
                    The contents of this tag will likely be identical to your usual html-format build target,
                    except you should change your <c>&lt;publication&gt;</c> to point to a new file, perhaps named
                    <c>publication/runestone.ptx</c>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Copy the usual publication file you use for your html-format build target and name it as
                    <c>publication/runestone.ptx</c> (or whatever you chose in the previous step). Edit this file
                    so your <c>&lt;html&gt;</c> element matches the example above.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Use <c>pretext deploy</c> on the command line to deploy your project to GitHub (it will walk
                    you through setup if you haven't deployed your project before). You do <em>not</em> have to
                    enable GitHub Pages unless you want to (GitHub Pages does not have the features of a Runestone
                    server, but can host your regular html-format build).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Log into GitHub and open an Issue at
                    <url href="https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/RunestoneServer/issues/new"/>
                    to request that your project be added to Runestone Academy. Be sure to provide the URL
                    of your GitHub repository (e.g. <c>https://github.com/UserName/repo-name/</c>). Runestone
                    Academy administrators will communicate with you via GitHub to complete this process.
                </p>
            </li>
