Generic Video Preview Image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2023-02-07: This image was previously provided for LaTeX output as a macro that resolves to a TikZ version.  See removed code and comments below.  In HTML we use an SVG we have mildly edited.  Search the HTML conversion for a template with name "generic-preview-svg".

The SVG image in this directory is a copy of the HTML SVG code.

ImageMagick's `convert` command has been used to make the PNG here.  The option `-density 600` was used to reduce pixelated lines.

The purpose of the PNG image is to be the static version created via the pre-processor.
