<!-- The "sanitize-text" template can be called on sizeable  -->
<!-- chunks of text, in a recursive manner, and then looks   -->
<!-- like runaway recursion.  "xsltproc" has a "-maxdepth"   -->
<!-- argument.  For the sample article, we increased it from -->
<!-- 3000 to 6000 to prevent a spurious error.               -->

<!-- We assume the source is in great shape, typically having been -->
<!-- created by a pretty-printing tool.  So we keep all the        -->
<!-- whitespace as being of interest to human reader.   This is    -->
<!-- the beauty of a separate stylesheet here:                     -->
<!--   (a) we can override the strip-space declarations            -->
<!--       of the main HTML stylesheet                             -->
<!--   (b) the election of the addition of source annotations      -->
<!--       is made by simply using a different stylesheet          -->
<xsl:preserve-space elements="*"/>
<!-- But whitespace in the root element gets regurgitated          -->
<!-- outside/before/above any file writing and ends up on the      -->
<!-- terminal.  So we kill it with no loss.                        -->
<xsl:strip-space elements="pretext"/>

<!-- Below, we use a purpose-built attribute to match elements which    -->
<!-- have been through the pre-proccessor with their (nearly-)original  -->
<!-- progenitors.  So we need this id here, late in the game, but we    -->
<!-- don't want authors wondering if they should be authoring it in     -->
<!-- their source.  So at the kast minute, while creating text versions -->
<!-- of source materil, we kill it.  Any similar leakage could be       -->
<!-- handled the same way.                                              -->
