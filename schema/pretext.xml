    <introduction>
        <p>This is a literate programming version of the <init>RELAX-NG</init> schema for <pretext/>.  As such, it is used to generate the <init>RELAX-NG</init> compact syntax version (<c>pretext.rnc</c>) and other versions are derived from the compact version with standard tools.</p>

        <p>We intend this to be helpful, for both authors and developers.  It is essentially a contract between the two.  If an author's source validates against the schema, then a developer's code should render the content accurately, or warn about why it cannot.  That said, it is still a work in progress.<ul>
            <li>New features are not added until they are reasonably stable.  Validating the sample article can be a good way to see what these are.</li>
            <li>Even for stable features, the schema will sometimes lag behind the code.</li>
            <li>There will be other inaccuracies here, so reports or pull requests are welcome.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>The <init>RELAX-NG</init> syntax is built on <term>patterns</term>, which describe how <init>XML</init> elements and attributes may be combined.  It begins with a <c>start</c> pattern.  Patterns separated by commas must appear in that order.  Elements separated by a vertical bar represent a choice.  Parentheses are used for grouping.  Braces are basic syntax, reminiscent of the syntax for Java.  An equals sign is assignment and <c>|=</c> is a continuation of an assignment.  Finally, optional and/or multiple occurences can be specified with modifiers:<dl>
            <li>
                <title><c>?</c></title>
                <p>Zero or one.  Optional, at most one.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <title><c>*</c></title>
                <p>Zero or more.  Optional, with no limit.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <title><c>+</c></title>
                <p>One or more.  Required, with no limit.</p>
            </li>
        </dl></p>

        <title>Gross Structure</title>

        <p>A <pretext/> document is always a single <c>mathbook</c> element below the root.  There are two divisions, a <c>docinfo</c>, which is a database of sorts about the document, along with a sibling element that indicates the type of the document and contains all the content.  (2019-02-08:  the root element may be <tag>pretext</tag>, and eventually <tag>mathbook</tag> will be deprecated.)</p>

        <title>Document Structure</title>

        <p>A document is typically divided into sections.  But we reserve the word <c>section</c> for one very specific type of division.  To avoid confusion, we speak generically of <term>divisions</term>.  So, for example, a <c>section</c> is a division of a <c>chapter</c>.  Here we list all of the possible divisions, even if they are not available in each document type.</p>

        <p>An <c>appendix</c> looks like a chapter of a <c>book</c>, with the option to have a <c>notation-list</c> or a <c>solution-list</c> as its entire contents.  It is possible this is not the best structure for an <c>article</c>, which might best be divided by <c>subsection</c>.</p>

        <p>There are several things to note (expand this): always a title, dead-end with blocks, or subdivide with optional intro and conclusion.</p>

        <title>Lightweight Divisions</title>

        <p>The <c>paragraphs</c> element, which is not to be confused with a <em>real</em> paragraph as implemented by the <c>p</c> element, is an exceptional type of division (both in design and utility).  It must have a <c>title</c>, can appear anywhere within any of the divisions, cannot be further subdivided, and is not ever numbered.  Its contents are conceptually a run of paragraphs, but as described here allow much more than that.</p>

        <p>It is especially useful in a short document (like a class handout, letter, memorandum, or short proposal) where numbered divisions might feel like overkill.</p>

        <p>The <c>NoNumber</c> variant allows for light-weight sectioning of un-numbered divisions, such as a Preface.</p>

        <p><tag>commentary</tag> is elective, so should not have any numbered items ever, so the <q>NoNumber</q> provision is implicit.</p>

        <title>Paragraphs</title>

        <p>Most <pretext /> elements are about delineating structure.  What you actually write happens in very few places.  Principally paragraphs, but also titles, captions, index headings, and other short bursts.  The shorter the burst, the more likely the text will be recycled in other places (Table of Contents, List of Figures, or Index perhaps).  And the more text gets re-purposed, the more care we need to take with its contents.</p>

        <p><term>Simple text</term> is simply runs of characters, some of which is accomplished with empty elements.  This is used for names of people, <etc />  It should not be confused with the RELAX-NG keyword <c>text</c> which matches runs of (Unicode) characters, with no intervening markup.  So the latter is used for things like <init>URL</init>s, internal identifiers, configuration parameters, and so on.</p>

        <p><term>Short text</term> is used for titles, subtitles, names, index headings, and so on.  It allows a variety of characters, font styling, groupings, and convenience constructions.  It does not allow for references, nor anything that typographically requires more than the linearity of a sentence.  In other words, no lists, no images, no tables, no displayed equations.  Because of the potential for movement, we also do not include footnotes within short text.</p>

        <p><term>Long text</term> is everything that is short text, but also allows for references, both external (internet <init>URL</init>s) and internal (cross-references).  It is used for the content of footnotes and captions.  The <webwork /> variant allows for variables in inline mathematics.</p>

        <fragment xml:id="shorttext">
        TextSimple = mixed {
            Character* }
        TextShort = mixed { (
            Character |

            Verbatim |

        <p>A paragraph is a key bottleneck between structure and prose.  You can use a variety of constructs in a paragraph, and you may use a paragraph in many places.  So the name of the element is very simple, just a <c>p</c>.  Now you can include footnotes, display mathematics, display verbatim text, and lists.  Note that a list can <em>only</em> occur in a paragraph, so to make nested lists you must structure a list item of the exterior list with a paragraph to contain the interior list.  A paragraph can contain some metadata, like index entries and mathematical notation.  It does not have a title, not is it ever numbered.  It can be the target of a cross-reference, but only with some care.</p>

        <p>A <term>lined paragraph</term> is a variant, for use when the line-by-line structure is necessary.  The <webwork /> variant of a <c>p</c> element allows for using the <c>var</c> element as an answer blank or generated content, possibly inside mathematics, and possibly inside lists.</p>

        <p>Note: A paragraph effectively could have the <c>MetaDataTarget</c> pattern, except that we allow index elements (<tag>idx</tag>) to go anywhere within the paragraph.</p>

        <p>Fundamentally <pretext /> allows for conversion to other markup languages, such as <latex /> or <init>HTML</init>, and of course <init>XML</init> is a syntax for designing a markup vocabulary.  As such, certain characters traditionally found on keyboards have been co-opted for special purposes.  And once you actually want one of those special characters, you need an escape character to indicate a <q>normal</q> use.  For these reasons, certain characters have empty elements to represent them.</p>

        <p>Special characters for <init>XML</init> are the ampersand, less than, greater than, single quote and double quote: <c>&amp;</c>, <c>&lt;</c>, <c>&gt;</c>, <c>'</c>, <c>"</c>.  The ampersand is the escape character for <init>XML</init>.  In practice, the first two characters are the most important, since processing of your <init>XML</init> will be confused by any attempt to use them directly.  So in regular text (not mathematics, not verbatim), always use the the escaped versions:  <c>&amp;amp;</c>, <c>&amp;lt;</c>, and perhaps <c>&amp;gt;</c>.</p>

        <p>See below for elements that can be used to form groupings with left and right delimiters.  For example, a simple quotation should use a left double quote and a right double quote, and these characters should look different (so-called <term>smart</term> quotes).  Notice that a keyboard only has a single <term>dumb</term> quote.  If you need these characters in isolation (<ie />, not in pairs), these are the best way to ensure you get what you want in all possible conversions.  Note that left and right braces (<q>curly brackets</q>) are previously defined with the <latex /> characters.</p>

        <fragment xml:id="delimiter-character">
        Character =
            element lsq {empty} |
            element rsq {empty} |
            element rq {empty} |
            element lq {empty}
        </fragment>

        <p>A space is a space.  But sometimes you want a space between two associated items which will not get split across two lines (<eg/>, Chapter<nbsp />23).  An element will create a <term>non-breaking space</term> using the right technique for the conversion at hand.</p>

        <p>There is a variety of dashes of various lengths.  Use the keyboard character for a <term>hyphen</term>, use an <term>ndash</term> to seperate a range of numbers or dates, and use an <term>mdash</term> as punctuation within a sentence to isolate a clause.  These are implemented differently for different conversions, so their use is strongly encouraged.</p>

        <fragment xml:id="dash-character">

        </fragment>

        <p>A <c>fillin</c> blank is not really a character, but maybe a really long, low dash?  The <c>characters</c> attribute controls the length.  It is atomic, indivisable, and content-less, like all the other characters.  <c>fillin</c> is also unusual due to its allowed use within mathematics.</p>

        <fragment xml:id="fillin-character">
        FillIn = element fillin {attribute characters {xsd:integer}?, empty}
        Character |=
            FillIn

        <p>We define a few characters to help with simple expressions in arithmetic.  The <term>solidus</term> is slightly different from the <term>slash</term> found on a keyboard and is used for fractions and ratios.  These are for simple uses in regular text, not for actual mathematics, which is described later.</p>

        <fragment xml:id="arithmetic-character">

        <p>The following are largely conveniences.  They are typically not available on keyboards, and their implementations for various conversions can involve some subtleties.  Again, their use is encouraged for the best quality output.</p>

        <p>Icons are available through a <attr>name</attr> attribute, which is meant to usually be more semantic than just a description of the picture, though that may sometimes be the case.

        <title>Blocks</title>

        <p>A <term>text block</term> is very similar to a paragraph.  It can be an actual paragraph, a sequence of paragraphs enclosed as a block quote (with attribution, perhaps), or a large chunk of unformatted text presented typically in a monospace font.</p>

        <p>A <term>statement block</term> is used in statements.  What are those?  Theorems have statements, exercises have statements, questions have statements.  Some of these blocks with statements also have proofs, hints, and solutions.  In statements, and their peers, we include text blocks, captioned items, asides, side-by-side layouts, and Sage computations, but exclude many of the numbered and titled division blocks.  The <c>NoCaption</c> variant prohibits all numbered items, but allows placement of items like <c>image</c>.  It also does not include <c>Sage</c>.</p>

        <p>A <term>division block</term> includes text blocks, statement blocks, plus topical chunks of text that can have numbered headings or numbered captions, with optional titles, and are set apart slightly from the surrounding narrative.  These are placed mostly as children of divisions, and so one cannot contain another.  They certainly contain paragraphs, and all that goes into them, such as mathematics (inline and display) and figures (and other captioned items).  The <c>sidebyside</c> element can be used to illustrate a division block with a variety of images and displayed text in flexible layouts.</p>

        <p>Other division blocks include <c>poem</c>, <c>aside</c>, and <c>assemblage</c>.  These are never numbered, but can have titles.  The <c>list-of</c> mechanism is a convenience device to automatically create lists of contents, and so we leave surrounding divisional structure to the author.  A <c>sidebyside</c>, and its cousin, <c>sbsgroup</c>, are strictly layout devices.  The <c>sage</c> element is unique for its possibilities in certain electronic formats.</p>

        <p><c>demonstration</c> is slated for removal or an overhaul, and so is in the <xref ref="badbank" text="title" />.  Avoid using them for now.</p>

        <p>Blocks are often structured, in a light way.  Hints, answers, and solutions adorn exercises, examples, and projects.  A simple introduction or conclusion is sometimes useful.  A <c>prelude</c> or <c>postlude</c> are authored inside a block and so are associated with it.  But they are presented before and after the block visually.  An <c>interlude</c> will be used between the statment of a theorem and its proof.</p>

        <p>When a block is structured to allow some of the ancillary parts, a <c>statement</c> element is used to structure the main part.  Hints, answers, and solutions can be the target of cross-references, but do not get author-supplied titles.</p>

        <title>Side-By-Side Layout</title>

        <p>Page width or screen width, both are at a premium.  Height goes on forever (barring physical page breaks) and we have many devices for demarcating that flow.  But sometimes you need to organize items horizontally, <ie /> side-by-side.  We place the components of a <c>sidebyside</c> into generic regions of specified width called <term>panels</term>.</p>

        <p>This is a pure layout device.  So you cannot title it, nor caption it.  It does not admit a <c>xml:id</c> attribute, since you cannot make it the target of a cross-reference.  Nor can you reference it from the index (but you can point to its surroundings from the index).</p>

        <p>Because of its utility, it can go anywhere a block can go (<ie />, as a child of a division) and it can go many other places as a sibling of a paragraph (such as to illustrate an <c>example</c>).</p>

        <p>Note that widths give on a <c>sidebyside</c> override any width given to the components of the panels.</p>

        <p>A <tag>stack</tag> allows non-captioned, non-titled elements to accumulate vertically in a single panel.  It is a basic container.</p>

        <p>A group of side-by-sides is designed to stack vertically with common controls on widths, etc.  Its implementation is entirely experimental right now, even if we are relatively confident of the markup.</p>

        <p>For <webwork /> the NoCaption variant allows <c>Tabular</c> and <c>ImageWW</c>.  This may change if these two items are liberated from <tag>sidebyside</tag>.  Presently, there should only be a single item inside a <c>sidebyside</c> inside a <c>webwork</c>, but we do not have a rule for that.</p>

        <p>There is a handful of elements which describe an item, but do not necessarily get processed as content.  Titles are an obvious example, and index entries are another.  Here we isolate a few common patterns to use for consistency throughout.</p>

        <p>Notes: <ul>
            <li>Language tags go on the root element to affect variants of names of objects, like theorems.</li>
            <li><attr>permid</attr> is part of managing editions, and is supplied by a script.  You should not be adding thse manually as an author.  (You do want to manually author <attr>xml:id</attr>.)</li>
            <li>The <c>xinlude</c> mechanism may pass language tgs down through the root element of included files to make them universally available.</li>
            <li>The <c>xinclude</c> mechanism inserts a <c>@xml:base</c> attribute on the root element of an included file.  So we allow this attribute on any element that allows a title.</li>
            <li>These are not unordered specifications since they contain several attributes, and we enforce a <c>title</c>, <c>subtitle</c>, <tag>shorttitle</tag>, <c>creator</c>, <c>caption</c>, <c>idx</c> order.</li>
            <li><c>MetaDataTarget</c> is for items that are targets of cross-references, but without even optional titles.  Since they will be knowled, they can appear in an index.  But without the potential to be titled, we do not set them up as possible root elements of a file to <c>xinclude</c>.</li>
            <li><c>MetaDataTitle</c> has a required <tag>title</tag>, and allows an optional <tag>shorttitle</tag>.</li>
            <li><c>MetaDataSubtitle</c> implicitly has a required <tag>title</tag>, and allows optional <tag>subtitle</tag> and <tag>shorttitle</tag>.</li>
            <li><c>MetaDataCaption</c> implicitly has an optional title.</li>
            <li>Titles may contain external references (<c>url</c>) or internal cross-references (<c>xref</c>), but implementers need not make them active (<ie />, they maybe text only), since titles are prone to migrating to other locations.</li>
