CSS Directory
=============

The CSS files here are experimental, and intended just for Jupyter notebook output.  They may not be current or accurate.  Inparticular, an author should need to use these in any way, and certainly they should not be copied and hosted with your project.

The CSS used in full HTML output are maintained at the [mathbook-assets](https://github.com/BooksHTML/mathbook-assets) GitHub repository.

The file `mathbook-content.css` is formed by removing any CSS not prefixed by `.mathbook-content` from `mathbook-3.css`.  The removed material is the first portion of the part delimited as `MATHBOOK UI MODULE`, but not this entire section.
