# This is an extremely simple demonstration of how to
# employ the pretext module in a Python application

# Import the module into the local namespace as "ptx"
import pretext as ptx

# Read arguments from the command line with the standard "sys" module
import sys # argv

import os.path # abspath()

# module is parameterized by the level of console output
# Not necessary, default is 0 and no output
# Maximum level set here
ptx.set_verbosity(2)

# directory/file locations provided on command-line by user
# routines in module expect complete absolute paths
xml_source = os.path.abspath(sys.argv[1])
dest_dir = os.path.abspath(sys.argv[2])

# we do one minimal task as the demonstration
# each <latex-image> in the source will give rise to a TeX file (only)
# various options are not employed
# function signature is
#
# latex_image_conversion(xml_source, stringparams, root_xmlid, data_dir, dest_dir, 'source')
#
ptx.latex_image_conversion(xml_source, None, '', None, dest_dir, 'source')
