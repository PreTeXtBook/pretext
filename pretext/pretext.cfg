#
# Instead, make a copy as  mathbook/user/pretext.cfg
# (Create the  user  directory at the same level as the mathbook/pretext directory)
# And perhaps delete this notice, as it may confuse you
# Only the options needing changes need to be listed in custom version
# Once you make a copy, you will need to add new configuration items
# "by hand", which is why there is a history of changes below
#
# Note that you may include command-line options for your commands, like so:
#   pdfcrop = pdf-crop-margins --threshold 200
# Sometimes command-line options require an equals sign. No problem:
#   pdfcrop = pdf-crop-margins --threshold=200
