# Instead, make a copy as  pretext/user/pretext.cfg
# (Create the  user  directory at the same level as the pretext/pretext directory)
# And perhaps delete/replace this notice, as it may confuse you.
# Only the options needing changes need to be listed in custom version.
# Once you make a copy, you will need to add new configuration items
# "by hand", which is why there is a history of changes below.
