# 2020-05-21: this is a quick-and-dirty attempt to provide 
#             backward-compatibility for the old  script/mbx  script

import os.path, sys, subprocess

msg = """*********************************************************************
*********************************************************************
The  script/mbx  script has been retired and has
been replaced by the  pretext/pretext  script.  You may need
to give this new script permission to execute.  Furthermore,
the stock configuration file, script/mbx.cfg, has moved to
pretext/pretext.cfg, requiring no changes on your part.
But if you have a custom configuration file, user/mbx.cfg,
then you will need to rename it to user/pretext.cfg.

PRESS A KEY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, and then we will
attempt to run the new script for you with either a new custom
configuration file, or if unavailable, your old one.

Please do not rely on this fallback behavior, and please make the
necessary changes soon.  We apologize for the inconvenience.
Thank-you.
