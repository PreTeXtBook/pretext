# MathJax (MJ) and Speech Rule Engine (SRE)

Offline support for conversions to EPUB, Kindle, and braille.

Requires installations of MathJax and Speech Rule Engine,
presumably via the node package manager, `npm`.

### `mj-sre-page`
A `node` Javascript program to generate representations of 
mathematics as MathML, SVG, braille, and speech.

### `update-sre`
bash script to mange npm installs, so SRE is not pinned to MJ.

### `package.json`
Manages dependencies for npm installs.
