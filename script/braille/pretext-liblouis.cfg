# Page formats are in two separate files, each containing
# *only* an "outputFormat" section.  They should be supplied
# to the "file2brl" program separated with a comma (only tried
# with no spaces, so command-line and Python would cooperate).

# Heading Styles
#
# We define five styles here, which we apply via CSS
# classes in the generated HTML via the semantic file
# See [BANA-2016, 4.2.1]
#
# heading1: "fullpage", e.g. titlepage, part
# heading2: "centerpage", e.g. chapter
# heading3: "center", e.g section in 4-deep
# heading4: "cell5", e.g. subsection
# heading5: "cell7", e.g. subsubsection

# [BANA-2016, 1.8.1]
# CSS "fullpage"
# centered, 3 lines before/after
# book, title page, part
# In slideshow: section
# TODO: linesBefore seems ineffective/unnecessary

# Boxed material,  [BANA-2016, 7.1.3, 7.2]
# 7, g used by NIMAS
# Bug? linesBefore has effect *after* the topBoxLine,
# so no real way to get a blank line prior
# linesAfter does follow bottomBoxline, so we can
# add a trailing blank line this way

# orphanControl is documented as "With this setting you can control
# how many lines of text of an element must be printed at least at
# the bottom of a braille page."  This can prevent a lone topBoxLine
# from being the last line of a page.  We set the value to 3:
# (1) top box line, (2) our PTX title/heading, (3) first line of
# text of the content.   This is 7.3.5.a below.
# There is no similar control to effect 7.3.5b.

# [BANA-2016, 7.3.5]
# Dividing Boxes Between Braille Pages
# a. A top box line must be followed by at least one line of text
# on the braille page. If the box line is followed by a heading,
# the heading must be followed by at least one line of text
# b. A bottom box line must be preceded by at least one line of
# text on the braille page.

# [BANA-2016, 7.3.1]
# Placement of Boxes.
# Whenever possible, keep boxed material on a single braille page.

# Lists,  [BANA-2016, 8.3.2]

# Mathematics
# We go to a new line for displayed
# mathematics, single-line or multi-line.
# liblouis seems to do the desired line-breaking
# by virtue of the div element
# But we squelch breaking across (embossed) pages
# NB: this will also break at the end, so
# PreTeXt manages all the content
