###########################################
# Braille versions of math from MathJax/SRE
###########################################

# mathjax puts braille Unicode characters into the 
# "title" element of an SVG, PreTeXt does not otherwise 
# use a "title" element.  The Unicode characters become 
# their ASCII Braille equivalents (it seems)

####################
# Document structure
####################

# We explicity kill the <head>, which is empty anyway,
# and note that the <body> contains the document
# We should not ever see <script> or <style>, but
# we could choose to kill them here as well
skip head
document body

############
# Paragraphs
############

# PreTeXt logical paragraphs get exploded into multiple
# HTML "p" to meet the requirements of HTML syntax.
# The breaks are dictated by displays, such as lists
# and mathematical displays.  We mark the "new", or
# "subsequent", paragraphs as a continuation.  So for
# Braille we do not indent these.

# Division Headings
###################

# PTX uses <br/> for lines of structures like address
# blocks of multi-line quote attributions

# Headings have styles, "headingX", which are given
# in the  pretext-liblouis.cfg  configuration file
# LUPM, 3.4.10, 2019-05-08, suggest 10 levels
# We associate styles with CSS values

# Always terminal, can be anywhere.  We fashion
# them with "box lines", identical to blocks

# Nemeth Math Indicators
########################

# Nemeth indicator use described in:
# Braille Authority of North America (BANA),
# "Guidance for Transcription Using the Nemeth
# Code within UEB Contexts Revised", April 2018
# Hereafter "BANA Nemeth Guidance"
#
# BANA Nemeth Guidance quotes "Rules of Unified English Braille 2013"
#
# 14.6 Nemeth Code within UEB text
#
# 14.6.1 When technical material is transcribed according to the
# provisions of The Nemeth Braille Code for Mathematics and Science
# Notation within UEB text, the following sections provide for
# switching between UEB and Nemeth Code.
#
# 14.6.2 Place the opening Nemeth Code indicator followed by a
# space before the sequence to which it applies. Its effect is
# terminated by the Nemeth Code terminator preceded by a space.
# Note: The spaces required with the indicator and the terminator
# do not represent spaces in print.
#
# 14.6.3 When the Nemeth Code text is displayed on one or more lines
# separate from the UEB text, the opening Nemeth Code indicator and
# the Nemeth Code terminator may each be placed on a line by itself
# or at the end of the previous line of text.
#
# Opening Nemeth Code indicator
# _%,  4-5-6 1-4-6,  x5f x25
# always followed by a space
# technically a UEB symbol
#
# Nemeth Code terminator
# _:,  4-5-6 1-5-6,  x5f x3a
# always preceded by a space
# technically a Nemeth symbol

# We write a "nemeth" tag as we produce Braille
# with the Speech Rule Engine.  We wrap it with
# the right indicators.  The spaces here are
# "non-breaking", which  liblouis  respects,
# and then converts to plain (x20) spaces.

# just get dropped as pure containers.  There is only one

# This will kill an empty div that formerly held all

# empty element?).

# Setting a "changetable" action is the closest we
