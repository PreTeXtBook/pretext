###########################################
# Braille versions of math from MathJax/SRE
###########################################

# mathjax puts braille Unicode characters into the 
# "title" element of an SVG, PreTeXt does not otherwise 
# use a "title" element.  The Unicode characters become 
# their ASCII Braille equivalents (it seems)

####################
# Document structure
####################

# We explicity kill the <head>, which is empty anyway,
# and note that the <body> contains the document
# We should not ever see <script> or <style>, but
# we could choose to kill them here as well

############
# Paragraphs
############

# PreTeXt logical paragraphs get exploded into multiple
# HTML "p" to meet the requirements of HTML syntax.
# The breaks are dictated by displays, such as lists
# and mathematical displays.  We mark the "new", or
# "subsequent", paragraphs as a continuation.  So for
# Braille we do not indent these.

# Headings have styles, "headingX", which are given

# Lists

# There are lists and then there are list items.  We want
# a simple list, or the outermost list of a set of nested
# lists, to always have a blank line before and after, so
# we give thos a style based on a class value, the others
# just get dropped as pure containers.  There is only one
# kind of list item.
# To get labels of list items, and the first bit of content,
# onto the same line, we place a throwaway element on the
# first block (when structured).  Instruction below is how
# we actually ignore it.

# Nemeth Math Indicators

# Nemeth indicator use described in:
# Braille Authority of North America (BANA),
# "Guidance for Transcription Using the Nemeth
# Code within UEB Contexts Revised", April 2018
# Hereafter "BANA Nemeth Guidance"
#
# BANA Nemeth Guidance quotes "Rules of Unified English Braille 2013"
#
# 14.6 Nemeth Code within UEB text
#
# 14.6.1 When technical material is transcribed according to the
# provisions of The Nemeth Braille Code for Mathematics and Science
# Notation within UEB text, the following sections provide for
# switching between UEB and Nemeth Code.
#
# 14.6.2 Place the opening Nemeth Code indicator followed by a
# space before the sequence to which it applies. Its effect is
# terminated by the Nemeth Code terminator preceded by a space.
# Note: The spaces required with the indicator and the terminator
# do not represent spaces in print.
#
# 14.6.3 When the Nemeth Code text is displayed on one or more lines
# separate from the UEB text, the opening Nemeth Code indicator and
# the Nemeth Code terminator may each be placed on a line by itself
# or at the end of the previous line of text.
#
# Opening Nemeth Code indicator
# _%,  4-5-6 1-4-6,  x5f x25
# always followed by a space
# technically a UEB symbol
#
# Nemeth Code terminator
# _:,  4-5-6 1-5-6,  x5f x3a
# always preceded by a space
# technically a Nemeth symbol

# This will kill an empty div that formerly held all

# are problematic.  ("no" processes interior,
# "skip" ignores everything)

# Inline snippets just pass through unmolested.
# We are likely getting bad line-breaks here.

# Setting a "changetable" action is the closest we
